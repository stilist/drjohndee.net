Anno 1581. Decembris 22. Mane.

Δ After my fervent prayers made to God , for his m{er}cif{ull}
  {...} {....} and inſtruction , the {....} the ministry of his
  h{..} and my {...} Angel , named Anael , ({yf} {it} {.a.}
  his Divine pleasure) I willed, the Skryer, (named
  Saul) to loke into my great Chryſtaline Globe, yf
  God ‹has› had sent his holy Angel Anael, or no:
And Saul loking into my {.}or{....}s stone, (or Chryſtall Globe)
for to s{...}e Anael , he {found} there Δone, {...}i{..} answ{ered} to
that name . But being {....}ſt{..} {....}ſt{.}s of me to tell
the Truthe yf he was Anaël , An other did ap{p...}
very bewtifull , with apparill yellow, glittering, like gold . and his
hed had beames like ſt{e}r beams , blasing , and spredding from it ; his eyes
fyrie . He wrote ‸in the stone very much ‹hebrue› in hebrue letters , and the
letters seamed all transparent gold. Which, Saul was not able {e}yther
presently to reade , that I might wri{te} after his voyce , neyther to
imitate the letters in short tyme .
A bright st{e}r , did go vp and and down by him .
There appeared allso a {wh}ite┌*┐ dog , with a long hed.
And many other visions appeared, with this second: the first being voyded
    quite away .            Therevppon I sayd, as follow{e}th.
Δ ⸺ In nomine Jesu Christi , quis tu es ? — he anſwered to Saul his hearing .
AN. ⸺ Potest{as} omnis , in me sit{a} est .
Δ ⸺ qu{æ} ?
AN ⸺ Bona, et mala .
Δ ⸺ Then appeared in the stone , these two letters M. G.
I then axing him ſom̅e queſtions , de Thoſaur{o} abſcondito :
       he anſwered ,
AN ⸺ Ne perturbes : Nam h{æ} ſ{un}t Nu{.æ}.
                            And withall appeared many {d}edd mens skulls,
                             on his left hand.
     He ſayd to me,
AN. ⸺ Vbi est potestas tua ?
Δ ⸺ Cur qu{æ}ris {..}e potestate aliqua mea ?
AN. ⸺ Cur ? Signifi:, non mihi placet .
Δ ⸺ I, therevppon , set by him , the stone in the frame :
     and sayd .
Δ ⸺ An bon{us} aliquis Angelus , assignatus est huic speculo ?
AN. ⸺ Etiam .
Δ ⸺ Quis ?
AN. ⸺ —‏‎מִי‏כָאֵל — he answered, by the shew of these letters {on} my ſtone
Δ ⸺ Bo{nus} ne ille Angelus, de qͦ in scripturus f{..} mentio ?
AN. ⸺ Maximè .
Δ ⸺ Tieri ne potest , qùod ego eundem vide{am}, et cu̅ illo a{q}am ?
AN. ⸺ Ita.       and therewith appeared this character ⸺ A
Δ ⸺ Quid p{e}r hoc, significare velis ?
AN ⸺ Alterius Angeli character est .
Δ ⸺ Cur hîc ; et nunc ostendis ?
AN ⸺ Cauſam ob magn[u?]m — Make an ende : It ſhalbe declared, but not by me{.}
Δ ⸺ By whome then ?
AN ⸺ By him that is aſsigned to the stone : but not , tyll after the feast . And then thow
     muſt prepare thy ſelf , to prayer and faſting
In the Name of God , be Secret : and in all thy doings praying, tyll thow haſt thy
desyre : which shall not be far of .
After Newyeres tyde , Deale , But not on the Sabaath day
Pray continually .
When it ſhall pleas god , to stir the vp , Then procede. In the brightest day ,
when the Sonne shyneth : In the morning , fasting , begynne to pray .
In the Sonne Set the stone .
Deale both Kneeling, and sitting . I have done for this tyme
My name is ANNAEL .
I will speak ones more to the : and than fare well : for thow ſhalt not
haue me any more.
                 Be not hasty in wrath .
Δ ⸺ Is this, that, you ment to speak ?
AN. ⸺ I. Do good to all men . God hath ſufficient for the, and for all men.
                        Fare well .
Δ ⸺ Gloria patri et filio et spiritui sancto . Sicut erat in principio ,
                et nunc et semper : et in sæcula sæculorũ
                            Amen .
Δ ⸺ Remember, that diuerse other particulars, mowght have byn Noted of this daye
        Action : but these may suffice:. And yet it is not to‸be forgotten , that
        as he sayd his name was Annael (with a dubble n ) to be allſo confeſsed
        him ſelf to be the same Annaël which is prepos{itu}s orbis veneris :
        and allſo Chief governor Generall of this great period , as I haue
        Noted in my boke of Famous and rich Dyscoueries .

In nomine Jesv CHRISTI. Amen.

Anno 1582. Martÿ die. 10. hora 11¼ Ante meridiem. Saterday.

One M ͬ Edward Talbot *cam to my howſe , and ‸he being willing and deſyrous
to see or shew ſom͠e thing in spirituall practise , wold haue had me to haue
done ſom͠e thing therein . And I truely excuſed my ſelf therein : as not in
the, vulgarly accownted Magik , neyther studied, or exerciſed : But confeſsed
my ſelf, long tyme to haue byn desyrous to haue help in my philosophicall studies
throwgh the Cumpany and information of the blessed Angels of God . And there⹀
vppon , I browght forth to him , my stone in the frame ( which was given me of
a frende ) and I sayd vnto him , that I was credibly informed, that to it
( after a ſort ) were anſwerable Aliqui Angeli bom . And allſo that I was
ones willed by a Skryer , to call for the good Angel Anchor , to appere in that
stone to my owne sight . And therefore I deſyred him , to call him : and (yf
he wold) Anachor and Anilos likewise , accownted good Angels. For I was
not prepared therevnto .  &    He then ſettled him ſelf to the Action : and
on his knees att my deſk ( setting the stone before him ) fell to prayer and
entreaty    &c     In the mean space, I, in my Oratory did pray, and make
motion to god , and his good Creatures for the furdering of this Action .
And within one quarter of an howre (or less ) he had sight of one in the
stone . but he still expected for two more : deeming this to be one of
the three ( namely Anchor Anachor Anilos ) . But I then cam to him ,
to the stone : And after som͠e thanks to God, and wellcome to the good
Creature, vſed ; I required to know his name . And he spake plainly ,
(to the hearing of .E.T.) that his name is VRIEL .
Δ ⸺ Are you one of them (sayd I, Joh͠n Dee) that are anſwerable, (vppon
  due observations performed ) to this stone ?
VRIEL ⸺ I am.
Δ ⸺ Are there any more beſyde you ?
VR ⸺ Michaël and Raphaël . But, Michaël est princeps in operibus nostro{s}
Δ ⸺ ys my boke , of Soyga , of any excellency ?
VR ⸺ Liber ille, erat Ad{æ} in Paradiſo reuelatus , per Angelos Dei bonos .
Δ ⸺ Will you give me any instructions , how I may read thoſe Tables of Soy{ga?}
VR ⸺ I can ⸺ But solus Michaël illius libri est interpretator .
Δ ⸺ I was told , that after I could read that boke , I shold Liue but two
  yeres and a half.
VR ⸺ Thou ſhallt Liue an Hundred and od yeres.
Δ ⸺ What may I, or muſt I do, to haue the sight, and preſence, of
   Michael, that blessed Angel ?
VR ⸺ Præſent{ia}s {.a͠.} postulate et invocate , sinceritate et humilitate
  Et Anchor, Anachor , et Anilos , non ſunt in hunc Lapidem invocandi .
Δ ⸺ Oh, my great and Long deſyre hath byn to be hable to read thoſe Table{s}
  of Soyga .
VR ⸺ H{æ}c maximè reſp{i}ciunt Michaëlem . Michaël est Angelus ,
  qui illuminat {g}re{ssu}s tuos. Et hæc revelantur in virtute et veritate
  non vi .
Δ ⸺ Is there any speciall tyme, or howre to be obſerved, to deale for
   the enioym{y} of Michael ?
VR ⸺ Omnis hora , est hora nobis .
Δ ⸺ After this, there Δappeared in the stone a strange seale, or
   character{iſmus} of this faſhion  enſ{uing} :
Δ ⸺ What is the intent, or vſe of this ?
*VR ⸺ Sigillum hoc in au{r}o sculpendium, ad defenſion͠e corporis, omni
   Loco , tempore et occaſioneſ. et in p{ec}tus gestandum.
Δ ⸺ So we ceaſed , with thanks to god : and I {...}ſt{..} much vppon this
    Action : and layd all vp in mynde, and w{riting} .
                 Δ ⸺ Soli Deo Honor omnis, et gloria.
                                Amen.

[page 9]

The same Saterday after none . Hora .5.

Δ ⸺ After that M ͬ E.T. had called Vriel , and I was com͠e to the stone
 and had vſed a short speche of thanks giving to God : ‹an› I then required
 some instruction for the purpose of Soyga
VR ⸺ Peace . you muſt vſe Michaël.
Δ ⸺ I know no meanes or order to vſe in the invocat{my} of Michaël
VR ⸺ He is to be invocated by certayn of the pſalmes of Dauid, and
  prayers . The which pſalmes, are nothing els, but a means vnto the
  seat and Maiestie of God : whereby you gather with your ſelues due
  powre; to apply your natures to the holy Angels . I mean the pſalmes ,
  commonly called the Seven pſalmes . You must vſe pleaſant ſa{uou}rs:
  with hand and hart : Whereby you ſhall allure him and wy{nn} him
  ( through Gods fauour ) to atteyn vnto the thing , you have long sowght for.
There must be Con{i..}ction of myndes in prayer, betyxt you two, to
  God contynually.
Yt is the wyll of God , that you ſhold , ioinctly , haue the knowledge
 of his Angells togither
You had atteyned vnto the Sight of Michaël , but for the imperfection
 of Saul.
Be of good Cumfort.
Δ ⸺ The chayre cam into the stone againe : and I axed what
  it ment .
VR.⸺ This is a seat of perfection : from the which , things ſhall be
 ſhewed vnto the , which thou hast long desyred .
Δ ⸺ Then was there a square Table browght into the stone : and I
   demanded, what that Table betokened .
VR ⸺ A Mysterie, not yet to be known . These two, ſhall remayn
in the stone , to the sight of all vndefyled Creatures .
you must vſe a fowre square Table , two cubits square : where vppon
muſt be set Sigillum Dei ‹D{uuni}tatis› , which is allready *perfected in a
boke of thyne :    Blessed be God , in all his Myſteries, and Holy in
all his works.    This seal muſt not be loked on , without great reurence
and deuotion  .  This seale is to be made of perfect wax .  I mean, wax ,
which is clean purified : we haue no respect of cullours.
This seal muſt be 9 ynches in diameter : The rowndness muſt be 27
ynches , and somwhat more . The Thicknes of it, must be of an ynche
and half a quarter . and a figure of a crosse , must be on the back ſide
of it, made thus :

The Table is to be made of swete wood : and to be of two Cubits high .
with 4 feate : with 4 of the former seales vnder the 4 feet.
Δ ⸺ The faſhion of the 4 feet , standing vppon the foreſayd rownd ſeales ,
   was ſhewed : ſo as the vttermost circle conteyning the letters, did ſeme to be
   clean *without the cumpas of the fete , equally rownd about the same fete .
   And these seales were ſhewed {mu}ch lesser than the principall seal .
   Vnder the Table did ſeme to be layd red sylk, two yardes square .
   And ouer the seal, did seme likewise red sylk to lye fowr square : somwhat
   broader then the Table , hanging down with 4 knops or taſsells at the
   4 corners thereof .
Vppon this vppermost red silk, did ſeme to be set the stone with the frame : nigh
  ouer , and vppon the principall seal : ſauing that the sayd sylk was betwene
  the one and the other
The Table was ſhewed to have on the fowre sides of it , *Characters and names
 these, that are in a schedule annexed , in 4 diuerse rowes .
VR ⸺ The characters and words on the sides of the square Table, are to
  be written with yellow , made of perfect oyle , vſed in the church.
Δ ⸺ What oyl is that
VR ⸺ of oyl ſhalbe opened vnto you . The oyle, is perfect prayers :
    of other oyle I haue no respect.
    We sanctifie , bycauſe we are holy : and you sanctify bycauſe of your holines
VR ⸺ There is a spirit, named Lundrumguffa vſing you
    who seketh your deſtruction , in the hatred of men , in the hurt of
    thy goods . Diſcharge him to morrow with Brymstone.
    He harmeth thy howſe , and ſeketh the deſtruction of thy dowghter .
    His pretence was to haue maymed the in thy sholder the last night ,
    and long ago .        Yf thow do not diſcharge him to morrow ,
    he will hurt, both thy wife and thy dowghter.
He is here* now
Giue him a generall dyſcharge from your family and howſe
He will seke Sauls death , who is accurſed.
Δ ⸺ I know no means, or art to do this by . For I did burn in flame
   of Brymſtone, Maherion his name and Character , whan I fownd
   Saul priuilie dealing with him ( which manner of wicked dealing
     I had oft forbydden him ). and yet he cam after, and wold haue
     carryed Saul away quick : as Robert Hilton, George, and other
     of my howſe can teſtify .
VR ⸺ The Curſed, will com͠e to the curſed.
Δ ⸺ I beſeche you to diſcharge him : and to bynde him ſom{ware},
wherefor of, as Raphael did ( for Thobias sake) with the wydke{d}
  spirit Asmodeus
VR ⸺ But Thobias did his part . Art is vayne, in respect {of}
   of God his powre . Brymstone is a mean
Δ ⸺ Whan ſhall I do this ?
VR ⸺ To morrow at the tyme of prayers.
          Δ ⸺ Gloria P{r}ĩ et filio et spiritus sancto
               sicut &c.  Amen.

Sonday. a Meridie hora .3ͣ. circiter

Δ ⸺ Vriel being called by. E.T. there appeared one, clothed with a
   long robe, of purple : all spa{ng}ed with gold. and on his hed, a
   garland, or wreath of gold : his eyes sparkling . of whome asked I ‹axed›
   Whether the characters {no}ted for the Table, wer perfect :
   He anſwered ,
⸺ They are Δ*perfect : there is no question
Δ ⸺ Are you Vriel.
 Than preſently cam in one, and threw the brave spirit down by the
  sholders : and bet him mightyly with a whip : and toke all his robes,
  and apparell of him : and then he remayned all hea{.}y and {o}w{y}gly .
  and styll the sprit was beaten of him , who cam in after him . And
  that spirit , which so bet him, sayed to the hearing of my skryer ,
  Lo, thus are the wyked skourged
Δ ⸺ Are you Vriel , who speaketh that ?
VRI ⸺ I am he.       Write down and mark this : for it is
worthy of the Noting .
This was thy perſecutor Lundrumguffa . I browght him hither : to let
   the see, how God hath puniſhed thy enemy
Lo, thus, hath God delt for the : Lo thus haue I delt for the :
   Thank God.
Δ ⸺ blessed be his holy name , and extolled, World with out ende .
E.T. ⸺ he drew the wyked spirit away , by the leggs, and threw him
  into a great pitt . and waſhed his hands , as it were , with the sweat
  of his ‹hed› own hed . for he ſeamed to be all in ‹‸{.}› ‹sweat› . a sweat.
Δ ⸺ Here vppon , my skryer ſaw Vriel go away : and he remayned out of
   sight a little while . Then he cam in agayn : and an other with
   him : and iointly thoſe two ſaid to gather. Glorifie God for euer.
   And than Vriel did ſtand behinde : and the other did set down in the
   chayre, with a sworde in his right hand : all his hed glyſtring like
   the Sonne . The heare of his hed was long : He had wings : and all his
   lower parts seamed to be with feathers . He had a roab ouer his
   body : and a great light in his left hand . he ſayd
Michaël ⸺ We are blessed from the begynning : and blessed be the name of
   God for euer.
Δ ⸺ My skryer ſaw an innumerable Cumpany of Angels abowt him :
    And Vriel did lean on the square table by .
   He that sat in the chayre (whom we take to be Michaël ) sayd
    Than.
     ⸺ Go forward : God hath blessed the
        I will be thy Guyde
        Thow shallt attey{n}e vnto thy sech{ing}
        The World begynns with thy doings
                    Prayſe God .
      The Angels vnder my powre, ſhall be at thy commandment
      Lo, I will do thus much for the
      Lo, God will do thus much for the
      Thow shalt see me : and I will be seen of the
       And I will direct thy liuing and converſation
       ℕ Thoſe that sowght thy life , are vaniſhed away.
                  Put up vp thy pen .
       Δ ⸺ so he departed.
       Δ ⸺ Gloria, {lau}s, honor, virtus et Imperium
           Deo immortali , invisibili , et
            Omnipotenti , in sæcula s{æ}culorũ
                     Amen

[page 11]

Martÿ 14. Wensday. mane circa hora 9ͣ.

Δ ⸺ Being deſirous to procede in this matter , by conſent, we bent
  our ſelues to Action . And after that ET had called Vriel
  and saw him , I cam to the deſk from my oratorie .
  There did contynually appeare , the chayre and the Table
  I than being affrayde that any other ſhold com͠e into the stone,
  in stead of Vriel , did erneſtly require the spirituall creature
  appearing , to show who he was , and what was his name :
  At length he anſwered , and ſayde to the hearing of E.T.
Vriel is my name , with diuerse called *Nariel .
                stay .
Δ ⸺ Then he went away, for a while: and cam agayn, and ſayd thus,
Vr. ⸺ The strength of God, is allwayes with the .
   Doſt thow know , what thow writeſt?
Δ ⸺ In two senſes, I may vnderſtand it : eyther that ‹God› the good
   Angel ΔGabriel is allwayes with me , thowgh invisibly : or els
   that the strength , and mighty hand of God , allwayes is my defenſe
Vr ⸺ Fortitudo Dei, tecum semper estſ.
Δ ⸺ He went away agayn , and cam agayn , following or wayting vpp{on}
  an other . and before that other, was a man hauing his hed all
  couered with blak . Then he that cam ſo in the middle , did sit
  down in the chayre , and spake this worde following :
Mi ⸺ Note
Δ ⸺ This was Michael, with his sword in his right hand
    Then cam Vriel to the man ( having his hed all hid, as it
    were in a blak hode ) and toke of that blak hode : and then
    lifted vp the Table cloth . He looked vnder it , and put it down
    againe : and lifted it vp again. The man stode still before
    Michael. Then Michaël roſe ; and toke of all the mans
    clothes , and left him, as it were, onely in his shirt
    Then Vriel toke a little rownd Tablet, as it were, of th{e}
    bignes of a sixpence, hauing
    two letters in it, thus :
    and gaue it to Michaël .
    Vriel lifted vp the Table cloth :
    and, from thence, ſeamed to take
    apparaile, and put on the man . it ſemed to be sylk : and
    very full of wrynkles , or plights . And the man kneeled, and held vp
┌up┐ his hands . Vriel toke like a lawrell buſh , and set vppon
    the mans hed. And than the man kneeled before Michaël.
    Michaël toke the rownd thing , with the letters : and gaue it the
    man to eat : and he did eat it
VR ⸺ Lo, things are covered .
Δ ⸺ Then he couered the Table and pluckt the cloth over it, down
  to the grownd, on euery side . The man roſe vp : And Michael
  clubbed him on the hed with his sworde . Then the man ſtode vp
Then the man turned his face toward E.T. the skryer. and the
  man did resemble me (Joh̅n Dee) in cowntenance . And then
  he turned to Michaël agayn .
  Michael wrote vppon the mans back , thus ,
             ANGELVS TVÆ PROFESSIONIS.
Δ ⸺ Then .E.T. aſked me, yf there were ſuch Angels of a mans
 Profession : and I answered yea ; as in ⁂Agrippa and other, is declared.
MI ⸺ leaue your folly : Hold thy peace.
  Haue you not red , that they that cleaue vnto God , are made
  like vnto him.
Δ ⸺ yes, forſoth.
MIC ⸺ Thow camſt hither to lern, and not to diſpute.
  Laudate Dominuni in operibus suis.
Δ ⸺ The man kneled down , and ſo went out of ſight .
MI ⸺ He hath eaten ſtrength against trubble : He hath eaten
  nothing : and in eating, he hath eaten all things . The ⁜name
  NA, be prayſed in trubbles.
Δ ⸺ Now Michael thruſt out his right arme, with the sword: and bad
   the skryer to loke . Then his sword did ſeame to cleaue in two:
   and a great fyer, flamed out of it, vehemently. Then he toke a
   ring out of the flame of his sworde : and gaue it to Vriel: and
   ſayd, thus
MIC ⸺ The strength of God, is vnſpeakable . Prayſed be god ,
   for euer and euer.
Δ ⸺ Then Vriel did make curſy vnto him .
MI ⸺ After this sort, muſt thy ring be : Note it .
Δ ⸺ Then he roſe, or diſapeared, out of the chayre, and by and by,
 cam again, and sayde, as followeth.
MI ⸺ I will reveale the this ring : Which was never revealed
  ſince the deth of Salomon : with whom I was preſent. I was
  preſent with him in strength, and mercy .
  Lo, this it is . This is it, wherewith
  all Miracles , and diuine works and wonders
  were wrowght by Salomon : This is it,
  which I haue revealed vnto the. This
  is it, which Philoſophie dreameth of .
  This is it, which the Angels skarſe know.
  This is it, and blessed be his Name :
  yea, his Name be bleſsed for euer.
Δ ⸺ Then he layd the ring down vppon the Table : and sayd,
 Note.
Δ ⸺ It shewed to be a Ring of Gold: with a seale graued in it.
 and had a rownd thing in the myddle of the seale. and a thing
 like a V, throwgh the top of the circle : and an L, in the
 bottome , and a barr — cleane throwgh it : And had theſe
 fowre letters in it, P E L E
 After that, he threw the ring on the borde, or Table : and it ſemed
to fall throwgh the Table : and then he sayde, thus ,
MI ⸺ So shall it do, at thy commandement.
     Without this, thow ſhalt do nothing.
 Blessed be his name, that cumpaſseth all things :
 Wonders are in him, and his Name is WONDERFVLL :
 His Name worketh wonders, from generation, to generation.
Δ ⸺ Then he went away : and cam in agayn by and by.
MI ⸺ Note
Δ ⸺ Then he browght in the Seale, which he shewed the other
 day : and opened his sworde, and bad the skryer, reade ; and
 he red            EMETH
 Then the sword cloſed vp agayn: and he ſayde
○MI ⸺ This do I do open vnto the , bycauſe thow mervayledſt
  at SIGILLVM DEI. This is the Name of the Seale :
  Which be bleſsed for euer. This is the seale self . This is
  Holy : This is pure : This is for euer. Amen.
Δ ⸺ Then the seale vaniſhed away. And I sayd to my frende
 (the skryer ) In dede, this other day, I considred diuerſe
  faſhions of this seal : and I fownd them much differing, one
  from an other : and therfore I had nede to know , which of them
  I ſhall imitate : or how to make one perfect of them all .
MI ⸺ Dowt not for the making of it : for God hath perfyted
  all things . Aſk not the cauſe of my abſence, nor of my
  apparell : for that Myſterie, is known to God . I haue no
  cloathing , as thow thy ſelf ſhalt see . I am a spirit of

Marty 15. Thursday. Hora 1¼ a meridie.

Δ ⸺ After ET his calling into the stone , appeared a tall man, with a sceptre
 (very great) of gold , glittring . His body all red : and out of his hed, did ſhote out
  beames of light , like the sonne beames .
Δ ⸺ I being deſirous, to know who he was , and his name, I requeſted him [erneſtly?]
    thereto . but he anſwered, as followeth .
⸻ Invocate nomen Domini, et agnoſcetis eum
Δ ⸺ Then I prayed the psalme , Deus misereatur {.}r͠i , et benedicat nobis &c
     after that, he ſayd
⸺ I am mighty .
Δ ⸺ Bycauſe he delayed to declare his name , ET the skryer did require
  him, in the name of God the father, Jesus Christ his sonne, and of the holy
  ghoſt, to expreſs his name : and he answered in speche
⸺ So I will by and by
Δ ⸺ Then he ſeamed to take from his hed little bright sparcks , like little candells
   endes : and to ſtick them abowt the chayre : and he went rownd abowt
the chayre : and than he spake, as followeth .
⸺ I am mighty, and working wonders : I am SALAMIAN .
   I rule in the hevens , and beare sway vppon erth in his name , Who be
   blessed for euer. Thow dooſt dowt at me . I am the servant of God ,
   in his light : I serve him . I say, I serve him , with ‹reverence and› feare.
   and reverence. My name is SALAMIAN : Mighty in the sonne ,
   worker of wordly actions , as well internall , as externall : known vnto
   God : Whose name I know , and bless for euer.
Δ ⸺ Then appeared a big flame of fyre by him in the ayre
Sal ⸺ Thow knoweſt not , or thow wilt not know , that Mamon , with
  his servants, are present abowt the : whoſe preſence doth hinder the preſence
  of the vertues Adonay our comming . Blessed be God , in the highest
   Amen .
Δ ⸺ He toke the forsaide flame of fyre, and flung it vp vnto the heven
  ward
Sal ⸺ Mamon is a king whome God hateth : whoſe ſect, contynually
   tempt , provoke and stir vp wickednes , against the Lord, and againſt
   his annoynted . But he dyeth : blessed be God for euer . Driue him away
Δ ⸺ It is incomparably more easy for you to do . And as for my parte ,
  I fele neyther in body, nor sowle , any token of his presence or working .
  Therevppon he cauſed the whole chamber ( which ‸we were in ) to appere very
  playnley in the stone : and so there shewed a great cumpany of wycked
  spirits to be in the chamber : and among them , one, moſt horrible and
  gr{iſe}ly? thretting, and approaching to our heds : and skorning, and gnaſhing
  at vs.
Sala ⸺ God determines his mysteries , by Arte and Vertue
Δ ⸺ Then he willed me very egerly , to drive them away . And I prayed
  fervently .   And there seamed One to com͠e into the stone , which
  had very long armes : and he draue away courra{g}iouſly : And
  so they were driuen away .
 After that preſently, cam one into the stone, all white
  Salamian reached this white one a Cup.
  The white man held vp the cup: and sayd , as followeth,
⸺ Lo, this is my name.
   God shall bless you . Fear not . your faithfullness provoketh me to tell
   my name , and this it is :(putting furth the Cup again ) for, I am called
   Medicina Dei . I will shew the , and I will shew you , the Angel of
 your Direction , which is called OCH
Δ ⸺ This name he spake : he shewed it allſo on the Table (before him) written.
Raph ⸺ He is mighty in the sonne beams . He ſhall profit the hereafter.
Δ ⸺ Then cam in an other , and sat down in the chayre : and he ſayde, as
   followeth .
⸺ The strength of God liveth : and God raigneth for euer
   I am Fortitudo Dei .
Δ ⸺ Why, then, you are Gabriel : and I toke you hitherto to be Michaël
┌Michael┐ How ſhall I then amend my boke , in respect of your name, allwayes,
┌wa{ie}s┐ before, written Michaël ?
For. Dei ⸺ What thow hast written , that hast thow writen: and it is true.
┌‸{..} {....} .┐ Write down this name POLIPOS .
       Doſt thow vnderſtand it ?
Δ ⸺ No , God knoweth.
For. Dei ⸺ When that day cometh, I will speak with the : yf thow
         obſerve that which I haue* commanded the .
         As truely , as I was with SALOMON , so truely will I be with the
Δ ⸺ ┌‸{....}.┐ Then cam in an other : whom we toke to be Vriel . for he went
 ┌went┐ allſo, as he was wont . and leaned at the Table .
For. Dei ⸺ search for wisdome and lerning , and the Lord will delieuer
          it vnto you .
Δ ⸺ I wold to god, I knew your name truely , or what peculier letter
   I might set for you , to Note your words and Actions by .
For. Dei ⸺ Name I haue none, but by my office .
           SALAMIAN cam not hither, but by me
           He is a mighty Prince, governing the hevens , vnder my powre.
           This is ſufficient for thy Inſtruction .
           I was with Salomon, in all his works and wonders :
             and ſo was thi s, whome God had appointed vnto him .
           The Dieuines know his name : and he is not hidden from the face
          ┌face┐ of the erth : His name is written in the boke wich lyeth in
           ┌in┐ the wyndow .
Δ ⸺ Do you mean Agrippa his boke ? And is it there expreſsed
   by the name SALAMIAN ?
For. Dei ⸺ I haue ſayde .
Δ ⸺ What order will you appoint vnto vs two , in respect of
   our two beings to gither ? My frende here, may haue other
   intents and purposes of his a[ff?]ayres , then will serve for me, for
┌for┐ his ayde hauing in theſe Actions .
For. Dei ⸺ Ioyne in prayers . For God hath blessed you . Dowt not .
           Consider theſe Mysteries .
Δ ⸺ Then they in the stone vſed talk to gither : but not well to be
  be diſcerned of the eare of E.T
   At length F.D talked very much, and spedily to E.T and
   diſcloſed vnto him ( which he expressed not to me, at the stone,
   but afterward ) all the manner of the practiſe , and circumſtance
   abowt the Action intended , with the Gold [lamin?],  the ring , the
   Seales &c And after I had spoken somwhat, in requeſting him ,
   to shew me the manner, How I ſhold artificially prepare euery thing
   spoken of{t} , he sayd
  Blessed be God, who revealeth all Myſteries . &c ‸
I am strength in nede.
And Lo, here is Medicine for the sore
We bless the Lord : We gouern the erth , by the societie of Gabriel :
Whose powre, is with vs : but he not here. &c
               Vse Patience
Vr ⸺ I lieued with Esdras : I liued in him , in the Lord, who liueth
     for euer.
Raph. ⸺ I leued with Tobie : Tobie the yonger.
Δ ⸺ This was the white creature, that spake this .
F.D ⸺ We liue in the Lorde : who be prayſed for euer.
Δ ⸺ I stode silent a good while .
F.D ⸺ what wilt thow ?
Δ ⸺ I did attend, what you wold ſay .
F.D ⸺ I haue sayd .
Δ ⸺ I haue byn long at this tyme , in my dealing with you . I truſt,
  I do not offend you therewith . But, for my parte , I cold finde in
  my hart to contynue whole dayes and nights in this manner of doing : euen
  tyll my body ſhold be ready to ſynk down for wearines , before I wold
  giue ouer. But I feare, I haue cauſed wearines to my frende here.
F.D ⸺ In vertue is no wearines .
Δ ⸺ Now they he ſtode vp, out of his chayr : and he, and they all, io{nictly}
  blessed vs , ſtretching theyr hands toward vs, Cr{o}ssingly . And so
    they went away. The Table and the chayre remayned.
      and the glyttring sparckles, or drops of ſteaming little
       lightes were of the chayre immedi{ate}ly .
                 Δ ⸺ Glorie, thanks, and honor
                     be vnto the Almighty Trinitie.
                               Amen

[page 20]

Δ After supper Mr Talbot went vp to his chamber to prayers: and
Vriel shewed him sself vnto him: and told him that somwhat
was amyss, in the Table or seale which I had <Noted>
byn occupyed abowt this day. And therevppon, Mr Talbot cam
to me into my study: and {....}red the seale (or Tables) o{f}
me: for he was wi{sh}ed to co{rrect} somthing therin, (sayd he).
I d{.l..}ed him the seal. and he browght it agayn with in
a little tyme after, corrected: both in the {numbers}, for {.n..}ly {.}
and some {f}or place. ouer or vnder. and also in one letter or
place omitted. Which I denyed, of any place {om}itted by me;
that was expressed {but} {me}. And the {.....} I dowted, vppo{n}
Michael his words last spoken, vppon two pla{c}es th{en} {remay}-
{ing} yet empty. s{taying} Hij duo c{aluti} {sunt} ad {tua}. But
If I had omitted any, the{re} shold m{on.} th{..} two haue wanted.
Wherevppon he thowght good to ax Judgmet and dess{...}n{g}
of this dowte, by Michael. And comming by stone
He was erdy: I propownded this form{er} Dowte. he answered
Mi. Veritas est sola in DEO. Et h{æ}c oia {ver}a sunt
you omitted no letter or {histo}ry that was told you. But the
skryer omitted to declare vnto you. Δ. May I thus re{cor}de {it}?
Yt is iustly reformed by Vriel: the one being omitted of the de{sci..}
and the other not yet to by vs declared, might make that phrase
meete to be spoken, Hij duo cælati sunt adhuc.
Mi. Thow hast sayd. Δ I pray you to make vp that one
place yet wanting. THen he stode vp on his great brasen leggs
agayn: He called agayn: Semiæl Semi{æ}l. Than he cam,
and kneled down. <T>
Consummatum est. Δ The shewer (a white man) pluckt
oute a trumpet, and put it to his mowth, as thowgh he wold blow: but bl{ew}
not: and there appeared at the ende of the Trumpet the greke ω
Mi. It is done. Δ Then of the three 666 before Noted, with his
finger he put oute the two lowermost. and sayd  Iste est numerus {suus}.
ANd Michael did put his finger into the Trumpets ende and pulled furth a rownd
plate of Gold, WHeron was the figure of .1. With many circles abowt
it, and sayd omnia vnum est.
Δ The forme of the world
which appeared before,
vanished away. And se
my{ei}l went away.
And Michael cam and
sat in his chayr agayn:
and his brasen leggs wer gone. and vppon {our} p{a}w{sing} he sayd
Mic. Go forward. Do you know what you haue allready written?
Laudate Dominum in sanctus eius.
Note the Circumference (which is done) conteyneth 7 names:
7 names, conteyn 7 Angels:
Euery letter, conteyneth 7 angels:
THe numbers are applyed to the letters.
Wh{an} thow dost know the 7 names, thow shalt vnderstand the
7 Angells.
The Number of 4, pertayning to the first T, is a Number significa{iu}e:
signifying, to what place thow shallt next apply thy eye: and begynningplaced aboue, it sheweth removing toward the righ thand. Taking the
figure for the number of the place applyable to the next letter to be
taken. The vnder number, is significatiue: declaring, to what place
thow shalt apply the next letter in the Circumference, twoard the left hand.
WHich thow must reade, vntyll it light vppon a letter, without {nuber},
not signifying. This is the Whole
So shalt thow fynde the 7 principall Names: known with vs, and apply
able to thy practise.
Make experience.
Δ Then {lell}ing from 4T, 4 more places (toward the right hand) exclu-
siuely, I finde in that fowrth place, from, T, (but ^being) the furth fro the
beginning, and with the begynning) this letter h: with 22, ouer it.
Therefore, I procede to the right hand, 22 places: and there I finde
A, and 11 over it. Going then toward the right ^hand 11 places, furder: I finde
a litt{le} a with 5. vnder it: by reason of which, vnder place of 5. I
go toward the left hand, 5 places, exclusiuely; where I finde o with
10, vnder it: whervppon I procede to the left hand, farder by 10 places.
and there I see the letter t, and 11, vnder it: and therfore {going}
to the left hand 11 places, I see there th eletter h alone without
any number. Wherfore, th{at} letter, endeth my word, and it
is a{ll} ThAaoth: ys this, as it shold be?
Mi. That is not the name. Thow shalt vnderstand all in the next
call. The Rule is perfect. Call agayn within an h{ow}re
and it shalbe shewed.
