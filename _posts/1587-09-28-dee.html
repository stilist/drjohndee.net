I delivered to
<abbr>Mr.</abbr>
Ed.
Kelley
(ernestly requiring it as his part) the half of all the animall which was made.
It is to weigh 20 ownces; he wayed it himself in my chamber: he bowght his
waights purposely for it.
My Lord
had spoken to me before for some, but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kelly had not spoken.
