his night I had the vision and shew of many bokes in my dreame, and among the rest was one great volume thik in large quarto, new printed, on the first page whereof as a title in great letters was printed “Notus in Judæa Deus.” Many other bokes methowght I saw new printed, of very strange arguments. I lent Mr. Edward Hopwood of Hopwood my Malleus Maleficarum to use tyll new yere’s tyde next, a short thik old boke with two clasps, printed anno 1517.
