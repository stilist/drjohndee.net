being Fryday, I rode to Syr John Byronâ€™s, to Royton, to talk with him abowt the controversy betwene the colledg and his tenants. He pretented that we have part of Faylesworth Common within our Newton Heath, which cannot be proved I am sure. We wer agreed that James Traves (being his bayly) and Francis Nutthall, his servant for him, shold with me understand all circumstances, and so duely to procede.
