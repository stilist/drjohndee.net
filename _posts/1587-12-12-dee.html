Afternone somwhat;
Mr.
Ed.
Keley
his lamp overthrow, the spirit of wyne long spent to nere, and the glas being
not stayed with buks abowt it, as it was wont to be; and the same glas so
flitting on one side, the spirit was spilled out, and burnt all that was on the
table where it stode, lynnen and written bokes, â€” as the
bok of Zacharius
with the Alkanor that I translated out of French for som by spirituall could
not;
Rowlaschy
his
thrid boke of waters philosophicall;
the boke called Angelicum Opus,
all in pictures of the work from the beginning to the end; the copy of
the man of Badwise
Conclusions for the Transmution of metalls;
and 40 leaves in 4o, intitled,
Extractiones Dunstani,
which he himself extracted and noted out of
Dunstan
his boke, and the very boke of Dunstan was but cast on the bed hard by from the
table.
