K. to me with these words, “My brother sayth that you study so much, and therfor, seeing it is to late to go to day to Cromlaw, he wisheth you to come to pass the tyme with him at play.” I went after dynner and playd, he and I against <abbr>Mr.</abbr> F. Gore and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Rob tyll supper tyme, in his dynyng rome: and after supper he cam and the others, and we playd there two or three howres, and frendely departed. This was then after the great and wonderful unkindnes used toward me in taking my man.
