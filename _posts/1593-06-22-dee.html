I had my copy of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Roger Dale our stuard, and had £5 the fine released of the Lord his bowntifullnes. I told the stuard that I had bowght the howse of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Mark Perpoynt, and he desyred to see the note of his copy, and so I did. I told <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Perpoint that I had byn at London to prepare his mony, and I told him that I had seen the court-roll for his copy. I went to London to fetch the £32 for <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Perpoint, and so I sent him word. This evening I browght the mony, but he was gon to bed. This morning I tendered the mony, and told it at goodman Welder’s before <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Stokden, and goodman Welder, but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Perpoint refused to perform the bargayn. Deus bene vertat!
