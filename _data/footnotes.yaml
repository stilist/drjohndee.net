      Biography of
      {{ "Newsam, Bartholomew" | person_tag }}:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <ins>C</ins>lockmaker to
        {{ "Queen Elizabeth" | person_tag: "Queen Elizabeth" }}, probably born
        at
        {{ "York, England" | place_tag: "York" }},
        carried on business in
        {{ "London, England" | place_tag: "London" }}
        as a clockmaker, apparently from the date of Queen Elizabeth’s
        accession. He obtained from the crown a
        <time datetime=P30Y>thirty years</time>’
        lease of
        {{ "Newsam's house, Strand, England" | place_tag: "premises" }}
        in
        {{ "Strand, England" | place_tag: "the Strand" }},
        near
        {{ "Somerset House" | place_tag: "Somerset House" }},
        <time datetime=1565-04-08>on 8 April 1565</time>,
        and there he resided through life. He was skilled in his craft, and was
        on familiar terms with
        {{ "Sidney, Philip" | person_tag: "Sir Philip Sidney" }}
        and other men of influence at court.
        <time datetime=1572>About 1572</time>
        the post of clock-master to the queen was promised him on the death of
        {{ "Urseau, Nicholas" | person_tag: "Nicholas Urseau (Ursiu, Veseau, or Orshowe)" }}.
        The latter had held the office under
        {{ "Queen Mary" | person_tag: "Queen Mary" }},
        and was reappointed to it by Queen Elizabeth. Newsam succeeded to the
        office
        <time datetime=1582>before 1582</time>.
        <time datetime=1583-06-04>On 4 June 1583</time>
        he received, under the privy seal dated
        <time datetime=1583-05-27>27 May previous</time>,
        <q lang=en-emodeng>{{ "GBP 32 shillings 8 pence" | currency_tag: "32<abbr>s.</abbr> 8<abbr>d.</abbr>" }}
          for mending of clockes</q>
        during
        <time datetime="1582/P1Y">the past year</time>.
        With the post of clockmaker he combined that of
        clock-keeper; the two offices had been held by different persons in
        Queen Mary’s reign, and Newsam appears to have been the first
        Englishman appointed as clock-keeper.

        (will). He died before
        <time datetime=1593-12-18>18 <abbr>Dec.</abbr> 1593</time>,
        when his will was proved by
        {{ "Newsam, Parnell" | person_tag: "Parnell" }}, his widow.
        Her maiden name was Younge, and he had married her at
        {{ "St Martin le Grand, York, England" | place_tag: "the church of <abbr>St.</abbr> Mary-le-Strand" }}
        <time datetime=1565-09-10>on 10 <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 1565</time>.
        He left four children:
        {{ "Newsam, William" | person_tag: "William" }} (born
        <time datetime=1570-12-27>27 Dec. 1570</time>),

        {{ "Newsam, Margaret" | person_tag: "Margaret" }},
        and
        {{ "Newsam, Rose" | person_tag: "Rose" }}.
        Edward,
        <q lang=en-emodeng>on condicion that he become a clockmaker as I am,</q>
        was to have his father’s tools, except his
        <q lang=en-emodeng>best Vice save one, a beckhorne to stand upon borde,
          a greate fore-hammer, and <ins>two</ins> hand hammers, and a grete
          long beckhorne in my back shoppe;</q>
        all these were to go to
        {{ "Newsam, John" | person_tag: "John Newsam" }}
        of
        {{ "York, England" | place_tag: "York" }},
        a clockmaker, and presumably a relative.

      <p>
        There is
        {{ "British Museum, England" | place_tag: "in the British Museum" }}
        a striking clock made by Newsam, which is still in almost untouched
        condition. It is of gilded brass, richly engraved. It is very small,
        not more than four inches high, and contains a compass; it has, of
        course, no pendulum, and but one hand. It is signed
        <q lang=en-emodeng>{{ "Newsam, Bartholomew" | person_tag: "Bartilmewe Newsum" }}.</q>
        The case is divided into two stories, the going train being in the
        upper, and the striking train in the lower story. Both the trains are
        arranged vertically, so that the clock is wound from underneath. The
        wheels are of iron, or perhaps steel, the plates and frames being of
        brass. It has fusees cut for catgut, which are long, and only slightly
        tapered. The hand is driven directly from the going fusee at right
        angles, by means of a contrate-wheel. The escapement is of the verge
        kind, and it has no balance-spring.
      </p>

      <p>
      The bequests in Newsam’s will confirm the evidence of his skill afforded
      by this clock. Mention is made there of
      <q lang=en-emodeng>a strickinge clocke in a silken purse, and a
        sonnedyall to stand upon a post in his garden;</q>
      of
      <q lang=en-emodeng>a cristall Jewell with a watch in it garnished with
        goulde;</q>

    <blockquote><p>
      In the most ancient record which I have seen relating to this parish, its
      name is spelt Chieham; it has since been varied to Ceiham, Chayham, and
      Cheyham, and has now, for
      <time datetime=P200Y>about two centuries past</time>,
      been uniformly written Cheam. As there is no word in the Saxon language
      nearly similar to the first syllable of the ancient appellation, I
      suppose it to have been a proper name; Ham is well known to mean a
      dwelling.
