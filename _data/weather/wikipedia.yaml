        <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spörer_Minimum>The Spörer
          Minimum</a>
        is a hypothesized
        <time datetime=P90Y>90-year span</time>
        of low solar activity,
        <time datetime="1460/1550">from about 1460 until 1550</time>
        <ins>…</ins>
        It occurred before sunspots had been directly observed and was
        discovered instead by analysis of the proportion of carbon-14 in tree
        rings, which is strongly correlated with solar activity.
