  <blockquote><p>
    The Aztec Empire, or the Triple Alliance was an alliance of three Nahua
    <span lang=nci>altepetl</span>
    city-states: Mexico-Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan. These three
    city-states ruled the area in and around the Valley of Mexico from 1428
    until the combined forces of the Spanish conquistadores and their native
    allies under Hernán Cortés defeated them in 1521.
