  <blockquote><p>
    In 1519, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan led a Spanish expedition
    with a fleet known as the Armada de Molucca to reach the Moluccas or
    Spice Islands (in present day Indonesia). After the death of Magellan in
    the Philippines in 1521 and following several other short-leaderships,
    the Spanish navigator Juan Sebastián Elcano led the expedition to the
    Spice Islands and ultimately the return trip to Spain, resulting in the
    first circumnavigation of the world in 1522. Thus the expedition is
    called the Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation.
