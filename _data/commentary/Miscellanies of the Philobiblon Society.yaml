    The following letter from
    the celebrated Dr. John
    Dee is preſerved in that
    portion of the Cecil MSS.
    which is depoſited in the State Paper
    Office. It is worthy of record, not
    only on account of the intereſt which
    muſt always be attached to a
    correſpondence between the learned
    mathematician, and the great miniſter
    of Queen Elizebeth, but as
    containing ſome curious information
    reſpecting the value ſet upon a work of
    reputation, and rarity, by the φιλοι
    βιβλων of the 16th century.
    The biographical notices of the
    career of Dr. Dee make mention of
    his frequent viſits to the Low
    Countries; whither he was attracted by
    the fame of the Univerſities, and
    their Profeſſors, but this unpubliſhed
    letter appears to be the only account
    extant of his trip to Antwerp at
    Chriſtmas 1561–2. He may after
    all have ſucceded in “ ſetting order
    with the Duch printers,” and by ſo
    doing have avoided the neceſſity of
    “ dealing with the printers of High
    Germany ;” or, poſſibly, Sir
    William Cecyl may have been proof
    againſt the ſtrong hints given by the
    indefatigable Doctor reſpecting the
    low ſtate of his finances. From
    ſome cauſe or other, his ſojourn at
    the Golden Angel was probably not
    protracted beyond Eaſter of 1562–3,
    and his absence from England may
    therefore have eſcaped obſervation.

    Joannes Tritemius, the author of
    the above mentioned book, was born
    in the town of Trittenheim on the
    Moſelle, in the year 1462.* He
    became Abbot of the Benedictine
    monaſtery of Spanheim in 1483, and
    of Wurzburg in 1506. The leiſure
    afforded by this comfortable
    preferment was employed by him in the
    production of numerous works, which
    are doubtleſs more creditable to his
    induſtry, than uſeful or intereſting to
    the preſent generation. His name
    is now only aſſociated with the art
    of writing in cipher, upon the
    perfection of which he beſtowed great
    labour, undeterred by the dangerous
    ſuſpicions which in thoſe days were
    incurred by all learned men whoſe
    purſuits happened to be
    unintelligible to the vulgar.
    In the prefaces to the two
    editions* of the Poligraphia, to which
    Dr. Dee refers, it is ſtated : “ Ad
    Joachim Marcionem
    Brandenburgenſem principem electorem * * * *
    ſcripſit mirandum, et laborioſum
    opus illud ſteganographiæ libros
    octo.” The earlieſt edition of this
    work in the Britiſh Muſeum†
    contains only three books. The earlieſt
    printed edition mentioned by Zedler‡
    is one in 4°, Franckfurt, 1606.
    Although the terms uſed in the letter
    of Dr. Dee would ſeem to imply
    that the “ boke for which a thouſand
    crownes have been by others offred,”
    was a printed one, yet from Zedler’s
    ſilence it is probable that it was only
    in MS. at the period of the viſit to
    Antwerp. No ſuch Manuſcript can
    be found in the Britiſh Muſeum, the
    State Paper Office, or in the library
    or amongſt the Cecyl MSS. at
    Hatfield, and it is probable therefore
    that no copy of the “ mirandum
    opus” is now extant.
    In the preſent days, however, ſuch
    unexpected diſcoveries are conſtantly
    made, and ſo many literary curioſities
    are from time to time exhumed from
    thegrave of centuries, that, haply
    ſome zealous antiquarian, after
    perſuing theſe Miſcellanies, may be
    albe to give ſome information as to
    the exiſtence of a printed edition of
    the Steganographia Joannis Tritemii
    prior to the year 1562 ; or may have
    it in his power to point out the
    reſting place of the actual copy
    preſented by Dr. Dee to Sir William
    Cecyl. Thus, poſſibly, may be
    recovered “ the moſt precyous juell, a
    boke ſo meet, ſo nedefull and
    commodious, as in humayne knowledg
    none can be meeter or more
    behovefull.”
    R.W. Grey.
