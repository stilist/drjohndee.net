    The gift of the Wardenship was in the Crown. The archbishop
    was John Whitgift, the opponent of Thomas Cartwright. His
    severity with the nonconformists led to his being ridiculed by the
    “ Martin Mar-prelate Tracts.” The peculiar relations of Dee to his
    livings often brought him in contact with Grindal and Whitgift. In
    July 1590 Dee had “ boldly” talked with the latter of his right to
    his two parsonages. On 12 Nov. Whitgift had given him £5 in
    reals and angels. But on 21 Jan 1591 the archbishop and the Lord
    Treasurer (Burghley) utterly put their suppliant “ out of hope” of
    recovering the two parsonages. In Aug. 1592 the archbishop told
    Dee of the Queen’s gracious speeches regarding him ; and in October
    Dee shewed him some blasphemous books which he wished the
    prelate to confute. On 7 Feb. 1594 Whitgift “ inclined sometyme
    to the request of dispensation.” In the same year Dee, supping
    with Whitgift, invited him to his “ cottage.” The following is the
    last entry in the Diary, before that cited above, illustrating Dee’s
    weariness in waiting for his promised advancement : “ June 29,
    After I had hard the Archbishop his answers and discourses, and
    that after he had byn the last Sonday at Tybald’s with the Quene
    and Lord Threasorer, I take myself confounded for all suing or
    hoping for anything that was ! And so adiew to the court and
    courting tyll God direct me otherwise ! The archbishop gave me a
    payre of sufferines, to drinke. God be my helpe as he is my refuge !
    Amen.” It was in this same year 1595 that Dee addressed to the
    archbishop his Discourse Apologetical.

    This was the patent for the wardenship. It took Her Majesty
    over two months to decide upon giving it to Dee. Dr. William
    Chadderton, the then Warden of Manchester and Bishop of Chester,
    had not yet, however, actually vacated the wardenship to fill his new
    see of Lincoln, to which he was elected 5th April (confirmed 24th
    May), 1595. The license to elect the new bishop of Chester was
    dated 25th June. ⸺ Wolley had long been of Dee’s acquaintance.
    The house of one Ambrose Wolley is mentioned in 1549 in
    connection with the tithe of Mortlake (State Papers, Edw. vi., Vol.
    vi. No. 35). In the year 1568 John Wolley was writing very
    courteous letters on Dee’s behalf. In the following year a Mr.
    Wolley is spoken of in a letter to Cecil as being “ well provided,
    having succeeded the late Mr. Ascham,” viz., the celebrated tutor
    (State Papers, Eliz. Vol. xlix. No. 66). The office was that of
    secretary for the Latin tongue to the Queen (Autob. Tracts, p. 10).
    “ The honorable Mr. Secretary Wolley” was one of the
    Commissioners appointed in 1592 to hear Dee’s Compendious Rehearsal,
    he then being one of her Majesty’s Privy Council. Sir John Wolley
    21 May 1594 moved Dee’s suit to her Majesty ; and she granted it,
    says Dee, “ after a sort; but referred all to the Lord of Canterbury.”

    The Temple Church and its purlieus were places of resort for idlers
    and others from the time of Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. The
    company to be there met with are referred to by Hudibras (III. iij.
    759), where a lawyer is mentioned as retaining
    “ all sorts of witnesses
    That ply i’th’ Temple under trees ;
    Or walk the Round with Knights o’th posts
    About the cross-legged Knights their hosts.”

   “ E. K.” was the medium Edward Kelley, who had been knighted
   by the Emperor Rudolph. Francis Garland was a frequent visitor
   to the continent, whither he took letters to Dr. Dee from his
   English acquaintance. In the MSS. in possession of Lieut.-Col.
   Carew, Crowcombe Court, Somerset, is a letter on Russian affairs
   from Edward Garland to John Dee, dated 1586. (IV. Rept. Hist.
   MSS. Com. 372 a.)

    Visitors to Mortlake made such inroads upon Dee’s time that he
    began to wish for a place of retirement “ from the multitude and
    haunt of my common friends and other.” This he could not have
    at Mortlake : “ the passage [by water] and way to my house there is
    so easy, neare, and of light cost from London or court.” Compendious

    Hickman was Kelley’s successor as “ Skryer.” He is frequently
    mentioned in the earlier part of the Diary, as well as subsequently.
    He was a native of Warwickshire, being born at Shrugborough 25
    Aug 1554 (Diary, p.1). He had become interested in the obscure
    sciences, and thus had heard of Dee, to whom he was introduced
    22 June 1579, by his uncle Mr. Richard Hickman, being commended
    by Mr. Vice Chamberlain Sir Christopher Hatton (page 5). In 1581
    Dee, travelling thro’ South Mims and St. Neots, came to Mr.
    Hickman’s and thence to Towcester (page 13, and cf p. 50). From
    all this it appears that Hickman’s home was in Northamptonshire.
    Ten years later Dee records (page 37) that “ Barthilmew cam up,”
    his daughter Jane entering at the same time into Dee’s service.
    Hickman’s visits to Mortlak were henceforth frequent, and they are
    entered in the Diary as if matters of importance hung upon them.
    The last entry in the Diary about Hickman, up to the point where
    we begin, is on what Dee calls “ the 2nd of our owld December,” which
    the Camden Society prints cold December (page 51): “ Barthilmew
    was preferred by me to the Lord Willoughby his servyce at Barbican
    in the presence of the Countess of Kent : and the Lord Willoughby
    did presently write his warrant to Mr. Jonson in Fletestreet, taylor,
    to deliver to Barthilmew his cloth and couishins, and so it was to
    Barthilmew delivered instantly.” Stowe describes the manor of Base
    Court, or Barbican, as “ lately appertaining to Peregrine Bertie,
    Lord Willoughby of Erseby” (p. 113). In 1568 Mr. Richard Bertie,
    writing from the Barbican to Cecil, says that having to send to Lady
    Strange, it would seem strange if he did not thank him for courtesies
    received. He has, he continued, hastened south on hearing of the
    dangerous illness of the Duchess of Suffolk : for the same reason
    Lord Monteagle’s men hastened northward (State Papers, vol. xlvii.
    No. 69).

    Dee’s dealings with his servants, who all in turn are mentioned in
    this Diary, make a distinct set of entries, which serve to shew the
    rates then paid for domestic service. It was due to Dee’s
    reputation in Mortlake that some of the inmates of his house became
    suicides when in his service.

      The money was wanted for fees for the Patent. The Privy seal
      for it, dated 26th May, 34 Eliz., states that the Queen of her own
      knowledge and ex mero motu granted to her beloved and faithful
      servant John Dee, Clerk, M.A., the place of Warden of the Perpetual
      College of Christ in Manchester, otherwise Manchester College, of
      her foundation, upon the promotion of Bp Chadderton to the see of
      Lincoln. In ample legal language the Patent invested Dee with all
      the rights &c. of the Wardenship, whether he were absent or present,
      during his natural life, in as full a form as Bishop Chadderton, or
      Bishop Wolton enjoyed them.

    This Earl of Derby was William, who had succeeded to the
    earldom in the previous year on the decease of his brother Ferdinand,
    who died under suspicious circumstances. The Earl was already
    well known as “ that great Sir William Stanley,” “ of whose travels,
    martial exploits, and bravery abroad, this county (especially) gives us
    many large accounts as well in story as song, and frequently make
    themselves merry therewith” (Seacombe’s Memoirs, ed. 1767, p. 65).
    He was owner of the buildings known as the College (now Chetham’s
    College), the residence of the Wardens ; and he was a party in some
    of the ecclesiastical arrangements of the parish.

     Dee was an industrious observer of the weather. This entry is

     the Diary from 1577 to 1601 have been extracted in the Ashmolean
     MSS. (Nos. 423 and 294) and are said to be very exact and particular.

    To prepare for Dee’s removal to Manchester. This Mr. Warren
    seems to be the “ secretary” of the entry on the 17th June. A Mr.
    Edward Warren had long been connected with the Derby family in
    various capacities. In 1587 upon a checkroll of Earl Ferdinando’s
    household Mr. Edward Warren appears as a “ gentleman-waiter,”
    and the same name apparently again occurs on a roll in 1590. He
    was, according to Canon Raines, the son and heir of John Warren
    of Poynton, and was buried at Stockport 14 Nov. 1609 (Stanley
    Papers, pt. ii. pp. 23, 84, 112).

    William Awbrey was a Doctor of the Civil Law, of All Souls,
    Oxford, and Queen Elizabeth’s “ little Doctor.” He was of a
    Brecknockshire family. His skill in the Laws caused him to be
    made Judge Marshall of the Queen’s armies, in whose reign he was
    frequently consulted on legal matters. He was one of the Council
    of the Marshes of Wales, a Master of Chancery, Vicar general to
    Archbishop Whitgift, and one of the Masters of the Requests.
    Moreover he was a person “ of exquisite learning and singular
    prudence.” He lived at Kew, and was a great friend to Dr. Dee,
    whose kinsman indeed he was. John Aubrey (Letters ij.214 seq.)
    prints a letter from Awbrey to Dee on Dee’s Soveraignty of the Seas,
    in the first sentence of which the “ young cousin” of the entries
    of May 9 and June 1st. is named. (See Fasti Oxon. i. 127, 143.) In
    1592 he and the Queen conferred about giving Dee “ a few advowsons
    of rectories endowed” in St. David’s diocese. According to the
    monument in St. Paul’s Cathedral the date of his death was “ xxiij
    Julii 1595.” On 25th of May of the former year the Diary (p. 49)
    states “ Dr. Awbrey moved my sute to her Majesty.”

    Dee’s birth-day. He now entered on his 67th year, and about
    this time the Ashmolean portrait (engraved in Lilly’s Life and
    Times, Bohn’s Hudibras, &c., and re-engraved in last month’s Local
    Gleanings) was painted. The Manchester people, and particularly
    the College-Fellows, began to be curious about their new Warden ;
    and one of them, Thomas Goodier of Manchester, made this call
    upon him. The visitor had, however, reasons of his own for thus
    introducing himself to Dee. Goodier had been, and perhaps was
    still so, the lessee of the tithes, &c., of the parish belonging to the
    Warden and Fellows (Duchy Calendar, iij. 286). After 1593
    Thomas Goodyeare married the widow of Ralph Sorocold a rich
    merchant of Manchester (Stanley Papers, pt. ii. page 143). Goodier
    and Dee were very soon at variance.

    It is unfortunate that the substance of these letters is not given.
    Carter, a native of Richmondshire, was a zealous Puritan and known
    as an able writer against the Roman Catholics. He was the author
    of An Answere to Certain Popish Questions and Demands, London,
    8vo. 1579, directed against Ritson’s Challenge. It was dedicated
    to Henry Earl of Derby ; and prefixed was an address to the Reader
    by Anthony Gilby. A copy is in the Chetham Library, the bequest
    of Canon Raines. It was printed by Thomas Dawson ; but is not
    mentioned by Ames. Carter was admitted at St. John’s College,
    Cambridge, in 1555 ; was B.A. 1559 ; Fellow of S. John’s 18th
    March 1561-2 ; M.A., 1563 ; admitted Senior Fellow 28 April
    1564 ; admitted Preacher 25 April 1565 ; B.D. 1569 ; and he was
    also bursar and sacrist of his College. About the year 1575 “ one
    Mr. Carter, a preacher att Manchester in Lancashire” had a loan of
    £2. from the executors of Robert Nowell’s Fund to be repaid 20
    March 1575-6 ; and soon afterwards he borrowed £2. more “ as by
    hys byll appeareth.” On 20 Nov. 1576, he received another
    loan of £5. being called “ Olyver Carter of Manchester” (Ath. Cantab.
    ij. 394, 554 ; Notes & Queries, 2 S iv. 130 ; Stanley Papers, ii.
    128 seq ; Nowell MS. page 256). Carter’s influence with the
    Fellows of the College and with the parishioners of Manchester
    seems to have been great. His strongest feelings were roused by
    the scandal of a man, of whom so many strange things were said,
    taking a place amongst the Fellows. In 15 Eliz. (1572-3) he was
    engaged in a lawsuit in the Duchy Court about a messuage and land
    at East Garston in Berks (Cal. iij. 4). In 18 Eliz. (1575-6) as a
    Fellow of the College, he prosecuted the then Warden Herle for
    unpaid wages (Ibid. 41). William Lord Burghley, writing from
    Greenwich to Bishop Chadderton of Chester, 12 Sept. 1581,
    speaks of conferring with Mr. Carter about leases of the Warden of
    Manchester (Peck’s Desid. Cur. 4to. i. 108-9). In 32 Eliz. (1589-90)
    Carter, in right of Richard Ascrofte, his brother in law, lessee of the
    Warden and Fellows of Manchester College, was plaintiff in an action
    in which John Chetham and Henry Slade were defendants, the
    matter in dispute being the tithes of corn and grain in Moston
    Hamell and Blakeley Hamell (Cal. iij. 237). The same year he
    himself was prosecuted in the same court with three other preachers
    (Thomas Williamson Preacher and Vicar of Eccles, John Buckley
    Preacher, and Robert Leighe), by Thomas Goodyeare of Manchester
    as Lessee of the Warden and Fellows of the foundation of King
    Philip and Queen Mary ; the action having relation to the dismes and
    tithes, of whatever kind or quality, Easter-Books, offerings, mortuaries,
    Chryson pence, and other profits belonging to the College, Church,
    and Chapels (Ibid. 286). Canon Raines states that in this action
    Carter seems to have established his claim against Goodyeare (Stanley
    Papers, ii. 130). During this time Carter had been one of the
    Moderators of the Monthly Lecture in Manchester, — a position which
    gave him great weight in the neighbourhood. Hearing of Dee’s
    appointment he was, as we see by the entry in the diary, soon on
    the alert. Dee had met his counterpart before (viz., 24 Oct.
    1593) in “ Mr. Gray, the Lady Cumberland’s preacher,” whose
    “ wrangling and despising alchimicall philosophers” he notes in
    the diary. When Dee came to know Carter personally he would be
    confirmed in a surmise that his character contained few elements of
    amalgamation with his own. Quarrels, infact, at once began.

    “ The very virtuous ” Countess of Warwick, as Dee elsewhere
    calls her, was the third wife of Ambrose Dudley (on whose death in
    1589 the Earldom became extinct), and was the daughter of Francis
    Earl of Bedford. She was intimate with Queen Elizabeth, and is
    often named as promoting Dee’s interests. It was she who, on 9
    Nov 1592, presented Dee’s Compendious Rehearsal to the Queen.
    She also acted as the friend of John Udall.

      Jane Dee’s maiden name was Fromond or Fromonds. She was a
      native of Cheyam (i.e. East Cheam), the daughter of Bartholomew
      Froumound, born 22 Ap 1555, and was married to Dee (whose first
      wife had died 15 March 1575) on 5 Feb 1578. In Oct of the
      same year she visited the Court at Richmond. On the morning
      following the day upon which Arthur Dee was born Mrs. Dee’s
      father died. Dee speaks of a brother Nicholas Fromonds (Diary,
      pp. 33, 39, 40); and a sister-in-law married … Mucko, a
      seller of Tobacco in Southwark (Ashmole MSS.). Mrs. Dee
      accompanied her husband upon his journey to Eastern Europe, and
      was one of the parties to the strange “ mixing of wives” at Trebona
      in 1587. Members of Dee’s family remained several years in
      Manchester after the concluding date in the Diary ; and Mrs. Dee
      was buried at the Collegiate Church 23 March 1604-5.
      The Lord Keeper was Sir Christopher Hatton. — The Countess of
      Cumberland, whose visits to Dee are noted intheDiary in 1593, was
      Lady Margaret Russell. Amongst the MSS. of Earl Spencer at Spencer
      House is a copy of a letter in which she gives a long and interesting
      account of her life from her birth in 1560 at Exeter, which closes
      imperfectly before the birth of Prince Henry (II. Report Hist. MSS.
      Commission, p. 15b). She became the wife of George Clifford third
      Earl of Cumberland, “ a most noble & martiall man both by sea
      and land,” and was the mother of the celebrated Countess of Dorset
      and Pembroke. — The Countess of Essex was the wife of the
      unfortunate Robert Devereux, who was beheaded and attainted in 1601.
      She was Frances, daughter and heir of Sir Francis Walsingham,
      Knt., and widow of the famous Sir Philip Sidney (Vincent’s
      Discoverie of Errors, page 187), with whose family Dee had been
      intimate. Sir Philip’s birth-date has puzzled his biographers ; but
      it is given exactly by Dee as 29 Nov 1554 (Ashm. MS 356, art. v).

    Durham House, a stately Hall in the Strand, was during the reign
    of Edward the residence of the Princess Elizabeth, who, c. 1583, gave
    it to Sir Walter Rawlegh. Sir Walter is once or twice named by
    Dee. On 18 Apl 1583 the Queen, going from Richmond to
    Greenwich on horseback, called for Dee ” by Mr. Rawly his putting her in
    mynde,” and said to him Quod defertur non aufertur, and gave her
    right hand for Dee to kiss. On 31 July of the same year Mr.
    Rawlegh wrote Dee a letter acquainting him of the Queen’s good
    disposition unto him (Dee). Ralegh was then in the sunshine of
    Court favour. In Feb. 1594-5 Rawlegh had returned from his voyage
    to Guinea, and was projecting the expedition against the coast of
    Spain.

    This countess was Lady Elizabeth eldest daughter of Edward Vere
    17th Earl of Oxford. She was married to William Earl of Derby,
    26 June 1594. So the Peerages ; but Vincent, Discoverie of Errors,
    p. 215, gives 26 January Aͦ 1594-5, adding that she had “ issue Lady
    Elizabeth Stanley, borne at Russell House Aͦ 1596, who died young
    1597.” The countess died at Richmond in Surrey 10 March 1626-7
    and was buried in Westminster Abbey. The daughter whose birth
    is here noted, as if for a horoscope, was perhaps Catherine the eldest
    daughter, borne at Rutland House, who died young (Brydges
    Peerage iij. 83), viz in March 1608-9 (Westminster Abbey Regrs., p. 109).
    In one of Carlton’s letters to Chamberlain, 29 March 1600, we read :
    “ Young Lady Derby has fallen into consumption since the birth of
    her last child and is given over.” (Dom. State Papers, cclxxiv.

    charter of 1578, were John Malyns, Alexander Nowell, Oliver Carter,
    and Thomas Williamson (Ibid., i. 90), all of whom, except Malyns,
    were perhaps present. What of harmony existed on the occasion
    between Dee and the College-body and its tenants was soon disturbed.

    Scarcely had the year’s grass begun to appe ar but Dee bestirred
    himself about the tithes of the College. The chief residence of the
    Byron family before the acquisition of Newstead in 1540 was at
    Clayton, near Manchester. Sir John Byron succeeded his father (of
    the same name) in the Lancashire and Notts. estates 1566 (Stanley
    Papers, ii. 165-6). In the Proceedings of the Manchester Court
    Leet, 1st October, 1567, it is said Sir John Byron had deceased
    since the Court last met, and that John Byron, Esq., was his son and
    heir (p. 109). The latter, the elder of Dee’s visitors, was Sheriff of
    Lancashire in 1572 and 1581 ; and in 1579 he was knighted by
    Queen Elizabeth. In 1578, as John Byron, Esq., he is entered as a
    tenant of the College of Manchester (Hist. Coll. Ch., i. 94-5). In
    1588 he was living upon his Royton estate, two miles north of
    Oldham  ;and his property extended to Failsworth and Gorton (cf.
    postea, 3 Sept). He died in 1603. His son John, created a knight
    in 1603, married Anne, eldest daughter of Sir Richard Molyneux,
    and died in 1622. (Brydges’ Collins, vij. 98, 559.) This gentleman,
    described as of Clayton, Esq., was in 1581 and subsequently one
    of the feoffees of the Grammar School of Manchester ; and his
    father, Sir John, was a feoffee at the same time. In the Camden
    transcript, “ Xyd ” per acre is unmeaningly put as the price of the
    hay-ground.

    Dee wrote, and did not go, to Mr. Ashton, whose residence was
    near Bolton. This individual is perhaps Ralph Ashton, who married
    Alice, daughter of William Hilton, of Farnworth. His father (of the
    same name) married Margaret, daughter of William Orrell, of
    Turton, Esq. In 1594 Ralph Ashton, Esq., of Lever, was Sheriff
    of Lancashire. The family were owners of property in the parish of
    Manchester. At the Court Leet, 1st October, 1617, Ralph Ashton,
    Esq., of Leaver, was reported as dead, and his son, Ralph
    Ashton, Esq., was his successor (Records, p.189). — For a note on

    The following pleasing letter will explain the reasons which led to
    the discharge of Cowly, whom Dee had brought to Manchester.
    (Letters of Eminent Literary Men, Camden Society, 1843, pp. 87-8.)
    The letter is addressed to Robert Bruce Cotton, the celebrated
    antiquary, one of Dee’s London associates, who was knighted at the
    accession of James I. Mrs. Cotton was a daughter of Wm. Brocas
    of Thedingworth, co. Leicester, Esq.
    “ Worshipfull Mr Cotton, I wrote a letter unto you, long
    synce, as concerning Antony Cowly, your servant ; who is
    often with me, and in my howse, comming and going. But
    still listening for advise or information from his frendes (whom

    or with your favor listen after some other means, whereby to be

    gladly receyve your answer herein, by word of mowth, or by
    your letter. And so shall I be free for [from] all offence giving
    to your wurship or any els in this cause : as I am most free for
    [from ] coveting, desyring, or longing after my neighbour’s wife,
    or any servant of his. Yf I might have a thowsand pound to
    solicit or procure any man’s servant to forsake his master or
    mistress, to come to me, or any other, I wold not do it,
    God knowes. I pray you that Mistres Cotton (your wurshipfull

    After an interval of three weeks, as we see, Dr. Dee, having received
    Cotton’s reply, discharged Cowly.

    Dee’s friends the Saviles, introduced into the Diary, may be
    identified with a little care. On 3rd February, 1583, “Mr. Savile,
    Mr. Powil the younger, travaylors, … cam [to Mortlake] to
    be acquaynted with me” (p. 18). Next occurs this present
    reference, in 1596, to Mr. Harry Savile, the antiquary, who again came to
    Dee on 5 July following. The only other mention of him is a note 28
    January, 1598, omitted by the Camden Society, when Mr. Harry
    Savile sent to Dee a present of fish from Lichfield. In the above
    note identification is made perplexing through bonk having been
    printed book, and Dunningley Denningley. Bank, or the Bank, the
    home of a branch of the Saviles, was situated on the Beacon Hill,
    overlooking Halifax. Both descriptions of the place occur in
    Watson’s Hist. and Antiq. of Halifax, pp. 303, 512 ; and it is called
    “ Banke” by Ant. à Wood in his notice of “ Long Harry Savile ” of
    that place, who entered as a student in Merton College, Oxford, in
    1587, at which time his kinsman, the more celebrated Henry, was
    Warden (Athen. Oxon., ii. 201). The latter was the “ traveller ”
    who called upon Dee in 1583 ; for it is said that soon after Savile had
    been Proctor to the University he travelled (viz., in 1578), into
    France and other countries ; “ and thereupon improving himself in
    learning, languages, and the knowledge of the world and men, he
    became a most accomplished person at his return.” After this
    followed his introduction to the Queen and his appointment to the
    Wardenship of Merton (1585), when he was something more than a traveller.
    “ The antiquary ” of 1596 would perhaps be “ Long
    Harry Savile,” who was M.A. in 1595, and whom Wood calls “ an
    eminent scholar, especially in the mathematics, physic (in which
    faculty he was admitted to practise in the University), chymistry,
    painting, heraldry, and antiquities ” (Athen. Oxon., ii. 201). He
    was a friend of Camden’s, to whom he described some antiquities
    near Ottley, Yorkshire. Hence his intimacy with his neighbour
    Saxton. He died in 1617.
    Sir Robert Cecil was the son of Lord Burghley by Mildred,
    daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke. Cecil had acted as secretary to
    Lord Derby, ambassador in France, and was in 1596 under-secretary to
    Sir Francis Walsingham. On the death of the latter he became
    Secretary of State and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. His
    house was in the Strand, next door to the Lord Treasurer’s. He was
    subsequently created Earl of Salisbury by James I., who called him
    “ my littill beagle.”

    It is not clear what this Commission for the College was. It was
    perhaps the draft commission, drawn up by Dee, and finally issued
    22 May, 1598, to inquire “ of the decaie and poore estate of Christ’s
    College in Manchester.” Another was issued, 13 June, 1600, to
    inquire concerning intrusions, &c., on the wastes of the manor of
    Newton. For both these commissions, see the Diary under the
    respective dates, posteà. Dee told the Fellows on 18th July, 1600,
    “ the most part of the things that I had brought to pass at London
    for the college good.”
    Nicholas Bagueley is mentioned in the Manchester Court Leet
    Records: Continuation, p. 41 (Cf. Stanley Papers, ii. 202). In 1546
    Nycholas Bagley held a tenement, &c., in Newton, at a rent of
    45s. 8d. per year (Lancashire Chantries, p. 12). A William
    Nicholson, of Moston, was entered inthe Court Leet Records as of full

    Brere is the Anglo-Saxon Briar, and Ruding or Riding is ridding or

    survey of 1322. In 1473 James Radcliffe, of Radcliffe, Esq., held
    in soccage one messuage with appurtenances in the Brere-riding

    This was a family company on a visit (perhaps from Lord Derby’s)
    to Lyme Hall. For William, the Earl of Derby here meant, see anteà,
    11 June, 1595. Lady Gerard was Anne, the daughter and heir of
    William Ratcliffe, of Wimersley, Esq. Sir Richard Molyneux, of
    Sefton, had been knighted in 1586, in which year he was M.P. for
    Lancashire. H e married Frances, eldest daughter of Sir Gilbert
    Gerard, Knight, of Gerard’s Bromley, Master of the Rolls, by Anne
    abovenamed. The third daughter of this marriage, Catherine, became
    the wife of Richard Hoghton, of Hoghton Tower (Dee’s
    guest), who had been Sir Gilbert Gerard’s ward : he was knighted in
    1599. (Cf. Stanley Papers, ii. 202.) Mr. Legh was Peter Legh, Esq.,
    M.P. for Wigan in 1586. His wife was Margaret (second daughter
    of Sir Gilbert Gerard), who was buried at Fulham Church under a
    large monument. Mr. Legh was a frequent guest at the Earl of
    Derby’s at Latham, and he subsequently became Captain of the Isle
    of Man. He was knighted in 1598. Canon Raines, in the Stanley
    Papers, pt. ii. p. 102, refers to this visit to Dee. The eminent
    lawyer, Gilbert Gerard, appears to be the person named in the
    proceedings of the Manchester Court Leet (Continuation, p.34), on
    4th April, 1594, when it was entered that “ Sir Gilbert Gerard knt. is
    departed, and Thomas Gerard knt. is his son and heir and at full
    age.” Their property in Manchester would be Garrett Hall, once in
    the Trafford family, purchased from Sir Thomas Gerard in 1595 by
    Oswald Mosley, clothier, of Manchester.

     Arthur Rowland was an intimate member of Dee’s household.
     The tithe-corn of Houghend and Houghpark belonged to the College.
     The visit concerned the survey of the township. Hough End, in the
     chapelry of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, was the seat of Nicholas Moseley,
     the well-known Lancashire clothier, who acquired a fortune by selling
     his wares in London. Of that city he was successively Sheriff,
     Alderman, and Lord Mayor. My copy of the Mosley Family Memoirs
     contains a portrait of “ Sir Nich. Mosly — Clothworker, Lord Mayor
     of the City of London 1599. Engraved from an Unique Print in
     the Collection of Sir John St Aubyn Bart.” In this plate Mosley is
     depicted in a civic dress, a ruff, and a hat ; the size half-length. For
     public services the Queen knighted him before the completion of his
     mayoralty, and gave him a carved oak bedstead for his new house at
     Hough End. In 1596 the manor of Manchester was finally
     conveyed to him by John Lacy for £3,500. He was High Sheriff of his
     county in 1604 ; and died at Hough End 1612, aged 85, his remains
     being placed under an elaborate monument in Didsbury Church.
     At the time of his decease he was at variance with the burgesses of
     Manchester about their right to pasturage in Collyhurst Wood, which
     he attempted to enclose and cultivate. In the next century Hough
     End came to be known as ye Hoose End, or Hough’s End.

    This Manchester Survey, which would be a valuable addition to
    our local topography, is not now known to be in existence. The
    earliest existing plan of the town is dated about 53 years later.
    Mr. Saxton finally left Manchester on the 14th.
    Christopher Saxton, who on the 15th June had been invited by
    Warden Dee to Manchester, and who arrived on 21st June, and
    came again on 5th July, to make a survey of the town, is too
    ingenious a character to be passed by without observation. He was a
    ative of Wakefield, and the author of the first maps of Britain from
    actual survey. The series of maps was nine years in preparation,
    and was first issued as a complete atlas of maps in1 579. The copy
    in the Chetham Library was once Sir Christopher Hatton’s, whose
    signature it bears. The maps of Cheshire, Lancashire, and
    Yorkshire were engraved in 1577, which is the earliest date found upon
    the series, and the date when most of them were engraved. Thoresby
    remarked that the maps had never been surpassed, scarcely equalled,
    for exactness (Loidis and Elmete, Ed. 1816, p. 240). Each map
    contains the arms of the Queen, who gave Saxton a patent for
    publishing the charts for ten years, and of Thomas Sackford, Master
    of Requests, in whose employment Saxton was at the date of the
    patent. Saxton was also encouraged by Sir William Cordel, Master
    of the Rolls. His skill as a chorographer is set forth in his epitaph.
    Thoresby says that in all probability he was buried in Batley Church.
    Dunningley, the place of his residence, was in the West Riding of
    Yorkshire, in the parish of W. Ardsley, 3 miles N.E. of Dewsbury,
    and the same distance east of Batley. Mr. Harland (Cont. Court
    Leet, p.87) could not find it. It appears in Saxton’s map under the
    orthography of “ Dunnyngley." Thoresby (Ducat. Leod., p. 195),
    under Armley parish, describes a monument of Danish times, viz. :
    “ Tinglaw, as it is in the best map that was ever made for this
    county,” which map was “ performed by Mr. Christopher Saxton,
    who lived at or very near that place.”

    This Mr. Matthew Palmer was subsequently the cause of trouble.
    (See 11th April and 19th July, 1597.) He seems to have been known
    to Sir Edward Fitton. (27th May.) His name occurs in connection
    with Margaret Byrom, of Salford, aged 33 years, a poor kinswoman
    in the household of Mrs. Starkie, of Cleworth, in Leigh parish, and
    one of seven persons who were demoniacally possessed by the influence,
    as was said, of one Hartley, a conjuror. Her possession began on the
    9th January, 1596-7. At the end of that month she left Cleworth and
    came to Salford, “ a town adioyning to Manchester,” with Hartley
    and another.
    “ The next morning,” says John Darrell, the narrator, “ as
    Hartley prayed over her in a fite, came one M. Palmer a preacher
    of Manchester, who asked him what he was doinge. He answeared,
    ‘Prayinge.’ — "Thou pray ! thou canst not pray,’ quoth he ;
    ‘what prayer canst thou say?’ — ‘None,’ saide he, ‘but the
    Lord’s prayer.’ — ‘Say it,’ 'quoth he ; the which as I remember
    he coulde not say. He then as a priuat man examined him ; and
    after, he had him before two Iustices of Peace : from whom he
    brought him by ther appointment to Margaret Byrom to hear
    what she could say against him. But as soon as she saw him,
    shee straightwaye became speechlesse, and was cast downe
    backwards, and so did the 2d time ; and 5 tymes was dumbe when
    Hartley came in her sight……The day before Hartley his
    execution was a sore day vnto her ; after which euery day she
    went to morning prayer, and was never troubled in the church
    save the 1st day whereon it tock her about the middest of the
    sermon in heaving vp her shoulders, depriuing her of her sences.
    After the recovery of her sences it tooke away the vse of her
    leggs ; and thus it molested her in the church to the admiration
    [wonder] of the people, about an hower and halfe.”
    Dee was also implicated in this curious case, but acted in it with
    singular caution. About the middle of November, 1596, when the
    symptoms of hysteria began to show themselves in the children,
    Mr. Nicholas Starkie, their father, consulted a physician in
    Manchester, who saw no sign of sickness.
    “ After, he went to Doctor Dee, the Warden of Manchester,
    whose help he requested ; but he vtterly refused sayinge he
    would not meddle [i.e., by using any magical influence] : and
    advised him that settinge aside all other helpe he should call
    for some godlye preachers with whom he should consult
    concering a Publicke or Privat Fast. He [Dee] also procured
    Hartley to come before him, whom he so sharply reproued
    and straitly examined, that the children had more ease for
    3 weeks space after. And this was upon the 8 of December
    [1596]. About New yeares day the children (being in good
    case as it seemed) went to Manchester, invited to a kinsman’s
    house, whom Hartley accompanied as ther overseer. And in ther
    returne homewardes, they were desirous to see Doctor Dee,
    according to ther promise and his request. But Hartley
    withstood them, and because they went to his house,
    notwithstanding his prohibition, he told them with an angri loke that
    it had bene better for them not to have chaunged an old frend
    for a new, with other menacinge speeches ; and so went before
    them in a rage, and never came neare them all the way home.”
    The narrative goes on to state that in consequence the violent
    symptoms recommenced on 4 January following.
    In another part of the proceedings the name of Dr. Dee again
    appears. Mr. Starkie, the parent, had been advised to give the
    possessed persons spiritual advice ; and he procured, says Darrell,
    “first one preacher, then an other, to see them ; but they knew
    not well what to say to their affliction. After hauing intelligence
    by D. Dee his butler of the like greuous affliction of Thomas
    Darling his vncles son, an [and] recouery vpon the aduice giuen
    by myself [Darrell], he [Mr. Starkie] requested D. Dee his letter
    unto me, though vnaquainted, and obtayned it ; wherewith he
    sent his owne also, which preuayled not with me. Therevppon
    he procured other letters whereof one was from a Iustice of
    peace thereby [Qy. Edmund Hopwood], and sent the second
    time vnto me. Then I crauinge first the aduice of many of my
    brethren in the ministry met together at an exercise [at
    Ashby-de-la-Zouch] : yielded to Mr. Starkie’s requset, and about 3
    weekes after went thither.”
    Darrell arrived at Cleworth 16th March, 1596-7 ; and the devils
    were duly exorcised. (A trve narration of the strange and grevovs
    vexation by the Devil of 7 persons in Lancashire, 4to, pp. 6-7 : 2; 8.)

    Weram is Weverham, Cheshire. The choice of his curates was a
    source of great trouble to the Warden ; for in the parishioners he
    had to meet strong Puritan elements, with which he had little
    sympathy. These entries seem to show that he himself was
    incapacitated from preaching. In former years Dee’s petitions were for
    benefices, without cure of souls.

    Frances, Countess of Hertford, is mentioned in the Diary in
    connection with some event which occurred at ¼ past 9 a.m. on 27 July,
    1578. She was an acquaintance of Dr. Dee’s, who named his own
    daughter after her. She was daughter to William Lord Howard of
    Effingham, and became the second wife of Edward Seymour, Earl
    of Hertford, whose first wife, Katherine Grey, had died in 1567.
    Frances Dee was born on New Year’s day, 1592. Katherine, who
    witnessed her sister’s cup put in pawn, was sixteen years of age.
    Crocker was one of Dee’s very favourite and confidential servants,
    and had been in his household from 1590 at least. (See postea, 30th
    Sept.) More plate was pawned on 17 Dec.
    Robert and Charles Leigh were two of the first singing men
    appointed by the foundation charter of 1578. Charles Leigh occurs
    as clerk of the Manchester Court Leet 1585-7 ; and in 1603-6 as
    steward. Jan. 14, 1592-3, was buried Jane, wief to Robert Leighe,
    Deacon of this Church (Manchester Register.) In 1593 John
    Buckley, one of the Fellows, bequeathed to Robert Leigh, one of
    the four clerks of the College, a book containing Nowell’s
    controversies ; and to his brother Charles, Beza’s Greek and Latin
    Testament. Charles Leigh was by the same will appointed the distributor
    of a bequest to the poor, and he attests the will. In the year 1600
    he was Receiver of the College. The two entries of burials which
    follow are from the Manchester Registers : 1620-1 18 March : Charles
    Leigh of Manchester the Elder Receauer for ye Colledge ; 1646 25

    Robert Stephens, the illustrious printer of the New Testament, and
    of the Thesaurus of the Latin language, was born 1503, and died
    1559. He was a man of learning, and edited several books at Paris
    and Geneva. The book lent by Dee to Heton was Concordantiæ
    Bibliorum utriusque Testamenti V. et N., novæ et integræ, fol. 1555.
    Pezelius’s De Cœna was a work published against the doctrine of
    Luther on the subject of the Eucharist, and in favour of the views
    of Calvin. The full title of an edition published at Lich (a small
    town in Hesse Darmstadt) in 1604, 8vo, is as follows : De Cœna
    Domini ; de vero intellectu verborum cœnæ ; deque vera tum præsentia
    tum manducatione corporis et sang. Christ., &c. (Bodl. Lib.) The
    author was a German divine (b. 1539, d. 1604), who became
    successively Professor of Divinity at Wittemberg and at Bremen, holding
    besides the oversight of the churches in the latter district. An edition
    of his Mellificium Historicum, fol. 1649, is in the Chetham Library.
    When Dee and his friends were leaving Bremen, on their journey to
    England in 1589, “ the excellent learned theologien Mr. Dr.
    Christopher Pezelius” printed some verses in commemoration of
    the circumstance, and they were distributed to the citizens and
    students who attended to see the travellers depart. (Compendious
    Rehearsal, pp. 33-4.)

    Dee’s books formed the only large library in Manchester, and he
    frequently lent volumes to his friends. (See 15th April posteà.)
    Edmund Hopwood, of Hopwood, Esq. (b. 1541 ; d. 1611-12, ) was “ a
    man of ancient lineage, a deputy-lieutenant of the Earl of Derby, in
    the commission of the peace for the county, and an ecclesiastical
    commissioner for the province of York, distinguished by the
    conscientious discharge of some difficult public duties, and justly
    endeared to the clergy whose respect, goodwill and confidence he
    possessed” (Canon Raines, in Visit. Dioc. Chester 1590, p. 19-22).
    Oliver Carter, Peter Shaw of Bury, William Langley of Prestwich,
    and others, described Hopwood as “ an earnest favourer of the
    preachers and the work of the ministry.” Mr. Hopwood was a
    reader of books, and his own collection was valued at £12. 5s. 8d.

    The octavo book on children’s ailments, as Thomas Windsor, Esq.,
    has informed me, was almost certainly a well known book, called
    De Morbis Puerorum, by Jerome Mercurialis, a learned and eminent
    Italian physician, printed at Venice, 1583 ; again at Basle, 1584,
    8vo., with other editions up to 1597.
    The case of demoniacal possession at Leigh in 1596-7, in the
    family of Nicholas Starkie, of Cleworth, Esq., already alluded to, pp.
    97-8, had directed attention to the subject of the exorcism of devils ;
    and in some counties, as e.g. Lancashire, books on this topic were
    quite as necessary to the magistrates as The Office of Justices of the
    Peace. Mr. Hopwood’s choice of literature was, moreover, not
    peculiar where there was a strong local belief in witchcraft, and when
    the personalty of the devil was a matter of faith. John Wier (born
    1515, died 24 Feb. 1588) was a native of the Duchy of Brabant. He
    studied under the celebrated Cornelius Agrippa, and became an able
    physician. His name is kept in remembrance from the fact that he
    was the first who, shocked at the barbarous treatment to which
    practitioners in witchcraft were treated, attacked the vulgar belief in that
    illusion. The full title of his work was De Præstigiis Dæmonum et
    incantationibus ac ueneficiis, and was first published at Basle in 1566,
    8vo ; again at the same place in 1583, 4to, a copy of which is in the
    Chetham Library. A French 8vo edition was edited by James
    Grévin in 1579, said to be more complete than the Paris edition of
    1567 and 1569, 8vo. In the Amsterdam edition of the Opera Omnia,
    4to, 1660, which I possess, this work occupies about 600 pages, in
    six books, dealing respectively with the illusions of devils, notorious
    sorcerers, witches, the bewitched, the cure of the bewitched, and the
    punishment of sorcerers and witches. The monks attacked the
    book and its author with great bitterness. Wier contended that those
    accused of witchcraft were persons whose brains were distempered
    by melancholy, leading them to believe that they had dealings with
    the devil, and that they were therefore more deserving of pity than
    of punishment. Many unsound views and fabulous statements are
    met with in his arguments ; but these errors, as Mr. Crossley has
    justly remarked (Potts’ Discoverie, pp. x. xi.), “ do not the less entitle
    him to take his place in the first rank of Humanity’s honoured
    professors, the true philanthropists and noble benefactors of mankind.”
    (Cf. Scott’s Demonology and Witchcraft, ed. 1831, pp. 184-5).
    The Flagellum and Fustis Dæmonum (The Whip and Club for Devils)
    were the works of a monk named R.P.F. Hieronymus Menghi, Mengo,
    or Mengus, of Vitellianensis. The Flagellum Dæmonum, seu exorcismi
    terribiles, potentissimi et efficaces, was published at Boulogne in 1586,
    8vo ; at Venice in the following year, in 4to, at the same place in
    12mo, in 1597, and in 1608 at Lyons, 8vo (all in Brit. Mus.) It
    was also printed in 1697 in 8vo, and at Milan(?) in 1727, 8vo,
    of which latter edition I have a copy, containing several grotesque
    pencil-sketches by Thackery the novelist. In 1582 it was included in
    L. Zetznerus’s Malleorum quorundam maleficarum, tam veterum quam
    recentiorum authorum, tomi duo, 8vo, Frankfort ; and in Robert
    Meiettus’s Thesaurus Exorcismorum, 8vo, Cologne, 1608. A work by
    the same author under the title of Fuga Dæmonum, adjurationes
    potentissimas et exorcismos formidabiles, atque efficaces, in malignos spiritus
    propulsandos, &c., continens ; acc. ejusdem remedia in malignos spiritus
    expellendos, was published at Venice in 1596, 8vo.
    The Fustis Dæmonum was published in 1582 in Zetznerus’s work
    above alluded to ; in Meiettus’s Treasury ; and in the second part of
    the 1727 edition of the Flagellum, where the title is given thus :
    Fustis Dæmonum, adjurationes formidabiles potentissimas, & efficaces in
    malignos Spiritus fugandos de oppressis corporibus humanis.

    Sir Urian Legh, of Adlington, near Prestbury, Cheshire, who died
    in 1627, married 6 Sept. 1586, Margaret, a daughter of Sir Edmund
    Trafford (Old Stretford, p. 20). He is described at that time as “ a
    young gentleman of great worship and good education.” For his
    services at Cadiz in 1596 he had been knighted. His brothers were
    Thomas, Edward, and Ralph.
    “ Mr. Wortley” may be Sir Richard Wortley (Foster’s Yorkshire
    Pedigrees), whose son Francis (afterwards Sir Francis) was, about
    1607, attending Oldham Grammar School with Sir George Radcliffe,
    under the Rev. Mr. Hunte. (Radcliffe’s Letters, pp. 19, &c.) His

    George Booth, Esq. (born 1566, died 1652), of the Booth family of

    messuages and their appurtenances at Dunham formed part of the
    possessions of Manchester College (Hibbert-Ware, i. 95), and there
    was some disagreement about it (Cf. 23 June posteà). Mr. Booth
    had evidently a good opinion of Dee. “ The Bishop” is clearly
    Chadderton. The Bishop of Chester had recently died ; but Vaughan
    was the bishop elect, nominated 16th May. A few days earlier
    Vaughan had desired that his confirmation might be performed at
    Lambeth by commission, the bishoprick being but small (Baker MSS.
    Mm. i. 45, p. 380). His request was made, through Whitgift, to
    Archbishop Hutton.

    Dee, a topographer and arithmetician of the first order, could
    never have been guilty of all the nonsense which is attributed to him
    by the transcript of the above entry printed in the Camden Society’s
    edition of the Diary. The perambulation is there given in the
    following manner : —
    “ May 4th, I, with Sir Robert Barber, curat, and Robert
    Talsley, clerk of Manchester parish church, with diverse of the
    town of divers ages, went in perambulation to the bownds of
    Manchester parish : beginning at the Leeless Bench against
    Prestwich parish, and so had a vew of the thre corne staks, and
    then down tyll Mr. Standysh new enclosure on the Low, wher
    we stayed and vewed the stak yet standing in the bank of the
    dich, being from the corne a eleven measures of Mr. Standleys
    stak then in his hand, and two fote more, which still I did
    measure afterward, and it did conteyn in Kentish feete 6 ynches
    and thre quarters. The survey geometricall of the very circuits of
    Manchester parish was ended in this, being the sixth day of
    my work.”
    The impression left on the mind in reading this passage is that
    Dee is dealing with stacks of corn. Three of them sub dio in May
    are scarcely to be conceived of in this climate. Another stack
    “ standing in the bank of a ditch,” at a distance from the aforesaid
    “ corn,” is equally perplexing. A stack in Mr. Standley’s hand,
    containing so many “ Kentish feet,” must have astonished the sober
    men of the town ! Then Warden Dee is made to work six days at
    the geometrical survey, when he is said two days earlier to have been
    otherwise engaged.
    By his will in 1593 John Buckley, Fellow of the College,
    bequeathed to Mr. Robert Barber, “ one of the ministers of the said
    College,” his large Geneva Bible in English ; and Barber was one of
    the appraisers of Buckley’s Library.
    This is the only contemporary picture that we have about the
    perambulations of Old Manchester. The ancient custom was in
    Dee’s time in pretty general use. It commonly took place during
    the Rogation Days, and was designed to supplicate a blessing on
    “ the kindly fruits of the earth so as in due time we may enjoy
    them,” and to preserve or establish an exact knowledge of the limits
    of parishes. There is an interesting account of one of these
    perambulations led by the judicious Richard Hooker, when parson at
    Boscombe in Wiltshire, in Walton’s life of that divine. A homily
    was prepared for the religious service, in which the Psalm “ Benedic,
    anima mea” was said or sung, and the malediction was pronounced,
    “ Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour’s land mark !” The
    Rogation Days in 1597 were the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th of May, and on
    the last of these days, viz., the Wednesday before Holy Thursday (or
    Ascension Day), the Warden gathered the parishioners of
    Manchester to perform this useful service, “ persuading all,” like Hooker about
    the very same time, “ both rich and poor, if they desired the
    preservation of love and their parish-rights and liberties, to accompany
    him in his perambulation ; and most did so.” In Dee’s Diary for
    the year 1596 there is nothing about beating the bounds of the parish on
    the 17th to 19th May, which were the Rogation Days ; but there are
    gaps in the entries about that date ; and his disputes with the Fellows
    may have interfered with a perambulation. The matter was of
    importance to Dee, on account of his quarrels with the landowners
    as to tithes from estates which were on the confines of the parish.
    In Canon Raines’ MSS. in the Chetham Library (vol. xxxij. p. 9),
    there is a very fine holograph letter, folio size, from Dr. Dee, bearing
    upon this very perambulation of 1597. The document, which is in every
    way characteristic of the writer, imparts a singular interest to the
    entry in the Diary, and indeed helps in the transcription of it. The
    letter is addressed to Mr. William Langley, Rector of Prestwich
    (from 1569 till 1611), who was the associate of Oliver Carter and
    other Puritan ministers of the neighbourhood, and who was
    commended by William Hinde as “ that holy man of God, and faithful
    servant of Christ in the House of God” (Life of John Bruen, p. 111).
    Cf. 11 Sept. 1600. It is evident from the memoranda upon the
    letter that the Parson of Prestwich looked upon the “ homely” request
    as a very formidable matter, portending litigation with a neighbour to
    be dreaded.
    Wurshipfull Mr. Langley, these are to certifie you, that
    the bownds of the Parishse* of Manchester, are now in

    (Endorsed in a modern hand.) Mr. Dee Warden of Manchester to Mr. Langley
    Rector of Prestwich abt yͤ Boundaries on Theile Moor, 1597.
    The “ extents” of the parish quoted on p. 395 of Mamcestre do
    not help to identify Dee’s landmarks. The passage in question
    puzzled Mr. Hariand (and no wonder), but he passed this “ Leeless
    Bench” without a note (Continuation of Court-Leet Records, Chetham
    Society, vol. lxv. p. 87). The “ Leeless Birch” passed out of notice
    with the decay of the tree. These graceful trees, which enter into
    the nomenclature of Birkdale, Birchley, Birchen Bowers, gave a name
    (Birch or Birches) to one of the hamels or hamlets of Manchester
    parish, and to other places in the same neighbourhood. The waste
    land over which Dee went in perambulation is variously written
    Thelmore, Theylmore, Theilmoor, &c. The name occasionally
    occurs in the Manchester Registers ; e.g., on 26 Aug. 1585, was
    buried Peter Cooke, of Thealmore ; and there was also Theyl-hill
    (vulgo, th’ equal). Dee writes the word somewhat indistinctly, and
    he might have meant Thelow (i. e., Theyl-low). The growing
    importance of Manchester led to the reclaiming of the wastes around
    it ; but it is somewhat extraordinary that the name Thelmore has
    died out, so far as its use by the inhabitants upon it is concerned. It
    is now difficult, even with extraneous help, to identify the landmarks.
    A clue to the discovery of the whereabouts of Thelmore was derived
    from Dee’s entry on 3 Sept., 1596, which concerned the boundary
    between Failsworth Common and Newton Heath, on which occasion
    Dee tried to make an agreement with Sir John Byron. What remains
    of Thelmore may now be seen on the six-inch ordnance map, in The
    White Moss, between the parish of Manchester and that of
    Prestwich-cum-Oldham ; but none of the other old names along the boundary are
    recorded upon it. The line of demarcation was a matter of contention
    for several years. James Asheton of Chadderton, Esq., the farmer of
    the tithes of Prestwich, was in dispute with the College of Manchester in
    the year 1600, and he was also at variance with James Chetham of
    Nuthurst, gentleman, who drew up the boundaries for the ecclesiastical
    commission which Dr. Dee mentions under date of 11th September in
    that year. There are several letters relating to the dispute, as
    affecting private individuals, amongst Canon Raines’s original letters ;
    and, as affecting the rights of the Warden and the College, I have
    copies of the commissions, interrogatories, and depositions, all of
    which are full of interesting matter, bearing not only upon the history
    of the Foundation, but also upon the inhabitants and the topography of
    this obscure quarter. One of the inquiries was prosecuted at
    Nuthurst, on the edge of the waste affected, 4 Nov., 1599. Amongst
    the witnesses was Randle Kemp of Newton, husbandman, who,
    19 July, 1600, borrowed of Dee Hollinshed’s Great Chronicle. Kemp
    deposed that the greater part of Theylemore did lye in the parrishe
    of Manchester, and a lessor part in the parish of Ouldam ; that he
    knew a brook called Mossbrooke and one little gutter or Ryndle
    running into it in this manner : from Theylmore Mosse into the
    Meyrelache [i. e., boundary water], thence betwixt certain ground of
    one John Cowper of the parish of Ouldam, and of James Chetam of
    Nuthurst, gent. ; that he knew a house and parcel of land in the tenure
    of Wydowe Cleaton, improved out of Thelmoore, on the east side of
    a place called the Meyrelach, which land was in Ouldam parsh, where
    its tithes belonged ; that he knew another enclosed piece of ground
    on the south-west side of Meyrelach, in the occupation of Robert
    Ogden, which was in Manchester parish, and tithes were paid to the
    Warden ; that “ he knew certen stakes or Rydges of moss standing
    vppon Theylemoore before the same stakes and Rydges were defaced,
    the which were meyres leading from the said Meyrelache or dytche
    along after the skirts of Theylehill (lately called the Equall vnto the
    end of Whytgate, and from thence neere to a dytche at the syde of a
    Close of William Tatton’s Esquire, lately improved out of
    Theylemoore, now in the occupation of Rychard Mathewe and James Ryle
    or of th’on of them. The wch dytche goeth alonge from the said
    howse following the sayd dytche vnto the top of Whyttmosse vntil it
    come to a stake called Corner stake wch is a meyre betwixt the
    Parishes of Manchester, Prestwich, and Oldham, and so from the
    Corner stake vnto certen pytts called Cycely Pytts or Rynnige pytts,
    and from the sayd pytts to one Tree called Leeless birch, being now
    or late nott far distant from the sayd pytts, and being a meyre
    betwixt the p’isshes of Manchester and Prestwiche.” — (Exchequer
    Depositions, Record Office.)
    On the word “ stake” the following note, from Instructions how to
    hold a Court-baron, may be cited : “ If any man hath removed any
    bounds or marks, meare stones or stakes, between this lordship and
    any other, or between tenant and tenant, you must present their
    names, for it is an evil office and they deserve to be punished for it.”
    ( Manchester Court Leet, p. 60 ; and cf. p. 50.)

    The dream of a bibliophilist. Books were frequently the subjects
    of the dreams of Dr. Dee. The Latin words are the title of the
    lxxvith Psalm. Mr. Hopwood was bent on mastering the literature
    of witchcraft. The Malleus Maleficarum was a compilation issued in
    1489, which took its origin from the bull of Innocent VIII. against
    sorcery, &c., in 1484. The title means The Hammer for Witches
    (German, Hexenhammer). It was not, as Scott (Demonology, p. 200)
    says, the work of Mengho, but of Heinrich Institor, Jacob Spenger
    and Johannes Gremper, who were the three Sorcery Inquisitors.
    They embodied in it all that could be gathered on the subject of
    witchcraft, and it contained numerous exorcisms. An account of it
    is to be found in Howitt’s translation of Ennemoser’s Geshichte der
    Magie. Watt mentions an edition dated 1494, Nuremberg, 4to, and
    calls it a very scarce book. It was embodied in Zetnerus’s work,
    Frankfort, 1582.

    Alport Park came into possession of the Derby family at the

    time been one of the possessions of the Wardens of the College. The
    estate occupied 95 acres, and was bounded by the rivers Irwell and
    Tib, the river Medlock and Quay-street. The Lodge is supposed to
    have stood near Aldport-street, and almost opposite the end of
    Fleet-street (see Hibbert-Ware, i. 102-3). When a few years ago
    a row of houses in Great Bridgwater-street were being pulled down
    for the Midland Railway Works, Mr. John Owen noticed that the
    back part of the houses was built upon a foundation of masonry,
    which he has no doubt was a relic of the Lodge. Hard by was the

    The stewardship of the College was one of the earliest official
    employments of the Chief Baron of the Exchequer who delivered,
    in Hampden’s case, the judgment upon the ship-money.
    Humphrey Davenport was the fourth son of William Davenport, of
    Bramhall, near Stockport, Esq., by Margaret, daughter of Sir Richard
    Ashton, of Middleton, Lancashire, and he was born about 1565 at
    Chester. In 1581 he was of Balliol College, and afterwards of
    Gray’s Inn (see posteà, 13 Oct. 1600). He was elected M.P. for
    Brackley 16 Oct. 1588, and was called to the bar 21 Nov. 1590. In
    June, 1623, he took the degree of the coif. King James knighted
    him, and Charles I. made him King’s Sergeant. It was in 1631
    that he became Lord Chief Baron. When in the year 1618 the
    large gallery was completed in Manchester Church, amongst the
    seats leased out to those who had been benefactors was Humphrey
    Davenport, of Salford, Esq. Hollinworth in Marcuniensis quotes an
    assertion of “ that accurate and exact lawyer, Sir Humphrey
    Davenport, Lord Chief Baron of His Majesty’s Exchequer,” that Manchester
    had early furnished burgesses to Parliament. He was impeached on
    account of the ship-money judgment, and he died March 1644-5.
    Fuller termed him “ a studied lawyer and upright person.” There
    are notices of him in Wood and Foss. (Cf. Earwaker’s East Cheshire,

    made it an essential part of education. A foine is a thrust with a

    Sir Julius Cæsar, the son of an Italian, a judge of the Admiralty
    Court, was at this time one of the Masters of Requests, and Master
    of St. Katherine’s Hospital. In 1591 Dee exhibited amongst his
    testimonials Mr. Dr. Cæsar’s letter dated 1577. Cæsar had
    connections in Manchester, for his second wife, Alice Dent of London
    and Mitcham, whom he married 10 April, 1596, was daughter to
    Christopher Green, gentleman, and Elizabeth Strangeways his wife,
    born in Manchester, and late wife of John Dent of London,

    Birch’s Memoirs of the Court and Times of James I., vol. i., p. 196,
    where it is said that Lady Cæsar made no conscience to forbear
    (i.e., hold off) the Earl of Salisbury, as he comes in her way, for
    his coarse usage to her husband. In a note it is misstated that she
    was the daughter of Christopher Grand, gent. Meanwhile Sir Julius’s
    promotion was rapid. He became Master of the Rolls in King
    James’s time ; and of his closing days Walton relates that he was
    kept alive beyond nature’s course by the prayers of those many poor
    whom he daily relieved.

    This gate would be the lower gate, or gate-house, opening into the

    vicinity of the College, and which is perhaps connected with Hunter’s
    Croft (the old name for the upper part of Canon-street), has relation
    to the chase. (Cf. Proctor’s Manchester Streets, pp. 2-3.) From the

    The close was one of the large enclosures, or fields, of the College,

    (2) The saving clause in Goodyer’s matter concerned Dee’s right,
    not Goodyer’s. See 12 July, 1595 ; 14 and 21 March, 1595-6. It
    was complained, 31 Sept., 1596, that Thomas Goodyeare the elder
    had encroached on the lord’s waste, near Cloughe House, hard by
    the church. Goodyer left some land in Ancoats to a daughter who
    married the ancestor of Dr. Leech, now of Whalley Range.
    (3) The Traves entry has not heretofore been printed. The family
    held college property in 1578. Hugh Travers was a burgess of
    Manchester in 1559 ; and the same year he, and Anne his wife, were
    two of the heirs of Ralph Trafforde of the Garret, Esq. John
    Traves, or Travers, of Blackley, of which place he is once called
    minister, was a friend of Bradford the martyr (Works ii. 1). Strype
    calls him “ a learned and pious gentleman.” George Travis was
    borough-reeve of Manchester in 1584 and 1591.
    (4) No Baxter appears in the Court Leet Records, except a butcher
    of that name, of Rochdale, in 1597.

    Cf. March 1, posteà. From these entries, as well as from those in
    the Compendious Rehearsal, it is clear that Dee had not relinquished
    his claims upon his rectory, for which in 1592 he had shewn to the
    commissioners a presentation by King Edward, dated 19 May, 1553.
    Upton-on-Severn is nine miles south of Worcester, and in Dee’s
    time contained about 113 families. The church, dedicated to
    St. Peter and St. Paul, is in Worcester diocese. The bishops were
    patrons ; and at this time Gervase Babington was bishop. The list
    of rectors in Nash’s Worcestershire (ii. 446) supplies the following
    list : — Johannes Hartley in 1550 ; Dee in 1553, at which time Bp.
    Bonner was beneficed in the same neighbourhood ; Seth Holland in
    1555 ; Thomas Baslard, presented by the bishop (Whitgift) 30 Mar.,
    1577 ; Gilbertus Bacchous (without date) ; Robertus Abbots, S.T.P.,
    6 June, 1598 ; Ricardus Eedes, mentioned twice — once appointed by
    the Bp. (Babington), 21 Dec., 1598, and again by the bishop, pleno
    jure, 21 April, 1599. His successor was appointed by King James
    19 Feb., 1624. Possibly, at the time Dee received the above news
    the rectory was again vacant.

    For Francis Nicolls, see 26 Oct., 1596. He was of Hardwick
    (three miles north-west of Wellingboro’), co. Northampton, the son
    of Thomas Nicolls of Pitchley, in the same county. Mr. Nicolls
    returned home five days subsequently. During the time of the
    Armada he had been in command of Tilbury Fort. By his wife
    Anna he had two children, one, Mary, who came with Dee to
    Manchester, 18 June, 1600, to reside there for a time, and so is
    occasionally mentioned in the Diary ; and Francis. Augustine Nicolls,
    brother of the elder Francis, was one of Fuller’s worthies, and became
    a justice of the Common Pleas. He patronised the Rev. Robert
    Bolton, the Puritan, a native of Blackburn ; and he died on circuit at
    Kendal, Westmorland, 3 Aug., 1616, aged 57 (Nichols’ Leicestershire,
    iii. 480 ; The Academy, 7 Sept. 1878, p. 237). Foxton is the

    This eclipse is mentioned, with a figure in a book, Eclipsium omnium
    ab A.D. 1554 usque in A.D. 1606. At sig. k (verso) is the
    following, kindly extracted by T. G. Rylands, Esq., F.S.A., from his copy of
    that work : —“ A.D. 1598. Eclipsis solis. Die vicessima quarta
    Februarii, Horis a meridie 23. minut. 11.” Other astronomical notes
    are given, from which it is ascertained that the times named are
    calculated, “ sub altitudine pole Augustana.” We also learn that
    Purbachius’ tables give “ Horis a merid. 23. min. 26.,” and that the
    Copernican calculation was “ Horis 22. min. 40.” The difference of
    two hours, or thereabouts, between the above time on the 25th Feb.,
    and that recorded by Dee, is to be explained, as Mr. Rylands shews,
    by the allowance for longitude, as well as by errors in calculation,
    the moon, three centuries ago, being for all purposes of such
    calculations an unreliable guide. The beginning of the eclipse
    (Purbachian) is 10h. 3m., according to the book Cyprianus Leonitius à
    Leonicia.

    bond of record acknowledged before the mayor of the staple, by
    virtue of which the creditor may forthwith have execution against the
    body, lands, and goods of the debtor on non-payment. It is founded

    This commission, which is too long to print here, concerned
    encroachments upon the manor of Newton.
    About twenty years later the chapter-house was the scene of
    quarrels as bitter as those which characterised the rule of Dee. In
    Sir Richard Murray, a Scottish immigrant, brother of the Earl of
    Annandale, the parish had a worse warden than his predecessor. On
    one occasion, taking a candle, he entered the chapter-house with Mr.
    Torkington and Mr. Bourne, two of the fellows, broke open the
    common-chest, and for his own aggrandisement abstracted therefrom
    the college-seal, the Register-book, and certain deeds. While this
    burglarious act was in progress, Mr. Daniel Baker, another fellow,
    was kicking at the chapter-house door, but not permitted to come in !

    Dee’s age at this time was 73 when the natural force of the pulse
    had fallen. The irregularity of the pulse is said by physicians to be
    due to serious disorders in the system. Sometimes the pulsations
    are more rapid than the rest, or a pulsation is at intervals left out.
    The latter is the intermission of the pulse which the old man noticed.
    For writers on the Pulse (De arte Spigmatica) Burton quotes Joseph
    Struthius and John Craton (Anatomy, ed. 1621, page 232; ed. Boston,
    ii. 6).
    Dee’s note is to the effect that for the first time in his life he had
    what physicians, skilled in the knowledge of the pulse, called an
    intermittent beating, that is to say, his pulse kept missing one
    pulsation after the fifth, or the seventh, or the eleventh, though it
    was at the time strong and equal. He was, he adds, very slightly
    unwell, but feeling somewhat disturbed about the disagreement of
    two of his seers (i.e., “ skryers,” of whom Hickman was one) in the
    things they saw.

    Dee is said to have been very happy in making reconciliations.
    Here are the hints of great dissensions which now reached another
    culminating point.
    (1) Dee would seem on some matters to have given way to the
    opinion of the Fellows or the parish.
    (2) Richard Holland, of Heaton and Denton, son of Edward
    Holland, was a man of some public note ; but Gregson, Booker, and
    others, who have dealt with the history of the family, have said little
    about him. He erected Heaton House, and was Sheriff of
    Lancashire in 1573, 1582, and 1596. He was very zealous against the
    recusants (Hibbert-Ware i. 110), in consequence of which Campion
    termed him “ a riged Puritan.” In 34 Eliz.(1581-2) he was
    concerned, in the interest of the Free Grammar School of Manchester,
    of which he was then a feoffee, in a suit in the Duchy Court, against
    the burgesses of Manchester, relating to the mulcture, toll, soken
    and profits, of the water-mills of Manchester for the support of the
    school (Cal. iij. 272, 287). In the possession of Nathaniel Booth,
    Esq., of Gray’s Inn, in 1737, was the copy of a letter signed Richard
    Hollande, dated Heaton, 3 May, 1586, to a noble Lord (Derby ?),
    entreating that his lordship would be present at the hearing of a
    cause in the Star Chamber, wherein his brother-in-law, Mr.
    Dokinfield, was concerned. In 1602-3 Holland interested himself in
    providing for the college a more suitable Warden than Dee. Holland
    married Margaret, daughter of Robert Langley, of Agecroft, and
    died in 1618, age 61. His will is dated 20 Nov., 1618 ; and he was
    buried at Prestwich, 3 March, 1618-19. His Inquis’ post mortem
    is extant. The family acquired the Heaton-Reddish estate in
    1326. His brother Edward is said to have succeeded to the
    property. Booker’s Denton, pp. 16 seq. ; Manchester Court Leet, 189.
    The present writer has a copy of the Basle edition of the
    Greek-Latin Lexicon, 1541, which may have been a book in use in the
    Manchester Grammar School in its early days. Besides the autograph of
    Ricardus Williams, Ludimagister, to whom the book belonged, there
    are school-boy autographs of Randolphus Holland (frequently
    repeated), Thomas Goodyer, Edward Wiliames, Thomas Reddish, &c.
    “ De Salford in the parysh,” is also scribbled by one of the boys.
    (3) Organs were frequently to be found in Lancashire churches
    before the Reformation. In 1552 we know that they were, e.g., in
    the churches of Rochdale, Middleton, Ashton, and elsewhere. The
    Reformers banished or discountenanced them. In the case of
    Manchester it took fifty years to get them back. Dealing with the
    unsuitableness of organs to the general simplicity of Nonconformist
    chapels, the Rev. Joseph Hunter remarks that the objection to music
    “ was a principle inherited by the Puritans from the first Reformers,
    who, amongst their other spoliations on the national taste, ruined
    our music” (Life of Heywood, p. 421). For a period music was again
    banished out of the old church, but it was reintroduced at the
    Restoration, when, as a writer quaintly says, “ our nation came into right tune.”
    (4) This Mr. Williamson was probably not the Fellow mentioned in
    the note, 2 May, 1597, but one of Dee’s numerous curates who, as
    was usual, gave no satisfaction to the parish. It is interesting to
    know that the preacher “ gotten from Cambridge,” was William
    Bourne, who had been admitted Fellow of St. John’s College,
    Cambridge, 11 Ap., 1595, being then described as of Staffordshire birth.
    About the end of the same year, he and a majority of the Puritan
    Fellows of St. John’s, amongst whom were William Crashaw and
    Abdias Ashton, signed a letter to Lord Burghley on the choice of a
    new master, in succession to William Whitaker. Bourne was then
    being complained of for nonconformity. Under date of 14 Dec.,
    1595, it is said of him by his opponents: “Mr. Bourne was chosen
    the last election from another colledge. This man went to my lord
    of Lincolne [Chadderton], that was then byshoppe of Chester, to
    take orders, which he could not have, because he refused to
    subscribe. And he was likewise at my lord of Peterborough [Dr. Richard
    Howland], and then repelled for the same cause, and at length he
    went into Wales to the byshoppe of St. Asaph [Dr. William
    Hughes].” (Heywood and Wright’s University Transactions, vol. ij.,
    pp. 67 seq.) Hollinworth says that he was sent down to
    Manchester by Drs. Chadderton and Whitaker at the request of the
    parishioners ; but Chadderton’s action in the matter is very unlikely.
    From the absence of his name in Dee’s Diary, it is probable that he
    came hither a few years after Whitacre’s death. Upon Bourne
    devolved the sole spiritual charge of the large parish, and his stipend
    was paid (not from the college revenue, but) by the inhabitants. See
    more on this subject under the year 1602-3.

    For Rendle Kemp see page 134. The Kemps of Newton held for
    many generations some of the churchlands in Newton, near the
    Warden’s house there. Cf. Hibbert-Ware, i. 94-5, where Ralph is
    named (1578).
    Raphael Holinshed is said to have been at Cophurst, in the
    township of Sutton, near Macclesfield. His great book on British
    history was founded on the collections of Reynold Wolf the printer,
    and of Leland, and was first published in 1577, fol. 2 vols. Dee’s
    edition was probably that of 1586-7, containing additions by John
    Hooker, Stow, and others. Shakespeare took some of his plots from
    the first edition. Prefixed to the book is a very entertaining account
    of the manners and customs of the English in the xvijth century.
    The frequent mention of Newton, or associations with it, in this
    Diary (cf. 20 April, 1596 ; 18 June, 1596 ; 14 June, 1597 ; 19 July,
    1600 ; 19 Jan., 1601), seems to point to something more than mere
    manerial connection, viz., to Dee’s residence there. Dee occasionally
    terms the college his “ lodging.” The residence of the Wardens
    in Deansgate, Manchester, was not provided until the middle of the
    17th century. As lord of the manor of Newton, residence there was
    in part incumbent on the Warden. His house would be that known
    as the Warden’s house, near the site of the old chapel. The Warden’s
    close, perhaps the land of the entry of 28 Jan., 1598, occurs in the
    Cathedral leases 1680-1754, and near it was the Priestfields.

    Dee’s son Rowland was a scholar on Bishop Oldham’s foundation.
    See 3 Dec., posteà. The blame of the imperfections must be cast
    upon Thomas Cogan, M.D., the High Master, and Edmund
    Cheetham. Cogan was a physician, the author, amongst other
    books, of The Haven of Health, issued in 1586, 1589, 1596, 1605,
    1612. My edition is that of 1596, “ now of late corrected and
    augmented.” He was appointed to his office in 1575 ; and it has
    heretofore been said that he attended to his duties with regularity
    and closeness. All this time he was practising physic with success.
    He was buried at Manchester 10 June, 1607.
    Edmund Cheetham, who was M.A., is mentioned 20 Dec., 1600,

    He was Humphrey Chetham’s elder brother. He died at

    The old man frequently dreamed dreams and described them in
    his notes. The enjoyment of the philosopher’s stone, in the first
    dream, has heretofore been denied to poor Dee. The singular
    dream of the following night is now also printed for the first time.
    Dee, as a Londoner born, describes with exactitude the locality of the
    scene of his dream. Aldgate, taken down in 1606, was the eastern
    postern of the city, and was over against St. Botolph’s Church. The
    soldiers were ranged within the walls towards the “ Towre hyll ” and
    “ Postern gate ” marked on Aggas’s map.

    Prebendary of Norwell Overhall, in the Collegiate Church of
    Southwell, from 1580 to 1614, when he was succeeded by William Barlowe,
    M.A. He was connected with the family of Sir Gilbert Gerard, M.P.
    for Wigan in 1553, and for Lancashire in 1585, and the Queen’s
    Attorney-General from 1559 to 1585. (Cf. note 26 June, 1596.) In
    January, 1585-6, Richard Gerrard was called upon by royal order to
    contribute £50, his share for the supply and equipment of two horses,
    out of £500 contributed by the clergy, and destined to assist the

    “ Actions” is Dee’s word for intercourse with spirits ; and
    Casauban’s folio has for a running headline, “ A true relation of Dr. Dee’s
    Actions with Spirits.” Thus, it seems that Dee burnt the records of
    all that Hickman had said that he saw in the shewstone. Though Hickman
    was hereupon discharged he became Dee’s skryer again in
    1607. Dee says elsewhere : “ All Barthilmew’s reports of sight and
    hering spirituall wer burnt ; a copy of the first part, which was
    afterwards fownd, was burnt before me & my wife.” Hence the absence
    of the “ Actions” of these years in Casauban’s folio.

    These passages shew that Nicolls was very intimate with Dee,
    and that he had attended the séances with Wortley and others,
    probably helping on the present occasion to expose the wrong dealing
    of Hickman. He died 4 April, 1604. William Nicolls, who had on
    this occasion come with his brother to Manchester, was of Tilton, ten
    miles east of Leicester, where he was living in 1619.
    This is the last entry in which Mary Nicolls is mentioned. Not
    ong after this date she died, aged 19, unmarried. On her father’s
    monument at…………, Leicestershire, she is called ” filia pietati
    charitate et virginitate speciosa” (Nicholls’ Leices. iij. 478, 480).
    Roger Cook had long been of Dee’s acquaintance. In 1581 Dee
    says that Cook had been with him from his 14th to his 28th year.
    In 1579 Dee revealed to him “ the great secret of the elixir ;” but
    there was a violent quarrel soon after. Another rupture, followed by
    a parting, occurred in 1581. He reappears in the above entry. Dee

    Arthur Dee has good claims to be considered a Manchester
    Worthy. According to a MS. in the Ashmole collection, he was
    born at 4h. 25m, a.m., on 13 July 1579 ☉ [solis] ortu. In a small 4to
    MS. in his own hand in the British Museum (Sloane, 1902), Arthur
    gives his father’s opinion on his horoscope as follows: Magna bona
    cum multis malis. ♐︎ [sagittarius] in domo ☉is [solis] significant quod
    mors nati erit subita: aut occidetur per ferrum aut ignem: et
    morietur extra Patriam suam ♌︎ [leo] in 8a dom. horrendam mortem
    prænunciat. Dns 8a in 7a morietur extra solum natale h in 7 tristitiam
    in conjugio vxoris separatio bonam fortunam a principibus. ☉♐︎
    [sagittarius] in 2 dissipat patrimonium, ad egestatem reducit impedimenta
    et pericula minatur extra patriam, a seruis vulnera. In his fourth
    year Arthur accompanied his parents to Eastern Europe. In 1587,
    while at Mortlake, Dr. Dee attempted to make him the successor
    of Kelly as “ skryer ;" and the boy was duly initiated with a solemn
    ceremony, which is described at length in the Relation. The attempt
    failed, and the father’s good sense pursued it no further. The boy
    was a scholar of Westminster School, but his name has been omitted
    from the list of the Alumni. He entered there, as is recorded in the
    Diary, in 1592, aged 13. The school was under Camden, the
    celebrated antiquary and herald, and Mr. Grant. Dee and Camden were
    already acquainted with each other. Dee copied for him one of the
    inscriptions at Manchester in memory of a Roman centurion ; and
    Camden, in his Britannia, refers to the service thus, “ Mihi descripsit
    qui vidit Cl. Mathematicus I. Dee Collegij Mancestrensis Custos”
    (ed. 1607, p. 611). To Camden, Dr. Dee sending up his son, wrote in
    his worst hand the following commendatory letter, now printed for
    the first time from the Cottonian MS. (Julius C. V. fo. 45), which, it
    seems, is the authority for à Wood’s remark, that the youth was of
    exceeding great and haughty mind, and naturally ready to revenge
    rashly. It forms a curious illustration of school-boy life of the time : —
    Worshipfull Syr, I haue here returned yor/. scholer vnto yor/.

    May 22, 1592.
    (Endorsed) To the Worshipfull my singular frende
    Mr. Camden these be Delivered.
    On his father’s removal to Manchester, Arthur Dee was seventeen
    years of age. He duly entered at Christ Church, or St. Mary Hall,
    Oxford ; but he is said to have left the University (without a degree)
    to practise physic in London, where he manifested a tendency to
    empiricism. “ From London (which he found uneasy to him) he
    went to Manchester in Lancashire, when his father then or lately was
    Warden of the College there, and settling in that place for a time he
    took to wife Isabella dau. of Edw [Edmund] Prestwych living at
    Holme [now Hulme] near to the same town” (Athen. Oxon. iij. 287,
    from the information of Arthur’s son Rowland). These statements
    want dating. The entries in the Diary shew that Arthur Dee was
    back in Manchester in 1600 and 1601, residing with his father,
    waiting for something to “ turn up.” A year or two later he married
    Isabella Prestwich, of Hulme Hall, one of the numerous children of
    Edmund Prestwich, Esq., who died in 1598. She was baptized at
    the Old Church, Manchester, 22 May, 1583. The baptisms of
    four of her own children are entered in the Manchester Registers,
    the dates of their births being recorded in MS. Sloane, 1902, in
    the British Museum : —
    Margaret (born 4 April), baptized 6 April, 1603, the father being
    called “ Arthur Dee, Gent.” She married Abraham Ash of
    London, merchant, and died 21 Jan. 1638.
    Jane (born 31 March), baptized 4 April, 1605.
    Arthur (born 16 March), baptized 17 March, 1607–8, the father
    being again described as a gentleman.
    Edmund, baptized 27 Aug. 1620, and called the “ sonne of Mr
    Arthur Dee, Doctor in physicke ;” buried at the same place
    (Coll. Ch.) 23 Sept. 1621, the father being again described on
    the last entry. His name does not appear in the Sloane MSS.
    In July, 1607, one of the subjects that Dr. John Dee had in view
    to consult the spirits was what his son Arthur should do “ to his help
    and comfort in his intended travel.” It is probable that Arthur Dee’s
    medical diploma was obtained on the continent. As is seen by the
    above entries, he was recognised as a doctor of physic in 1620.
    “ At length,” continues Wood, still without dates, “ the Emperor of
    Russia desiring King James I. of England, to send him one of his
    physicians, he forthwith nominated our author, A. Dee, as a very fit
    person. So that soon after obtaining letters of commendation, he
    went into that country, where he continued physician to the said
    Emperor 14 years or more.” The Ashmole MS. says 18 years.
    The only royal letter of introduction to be found in the State
    papers is one in 1627, supposed to belong to May of that year.
    is the draft of a letter to be signed by Charles I., who
    recommends Dr. Dee, Capt. Gilbert, John Scrope, and others, to
    the Emperor of Russia, viz., Michael III., the first Czar,
    who reigned 1613 to 1645 ; and they are to have the King’s
    leave to serve that Emperor. On 11 June, 1627, Secretary Coke,
    writing from Whitehall to Secretary Conway, forwards a letter to the
    Emperor of Russia to be sent by Dr. Dee or his agent ; if not
    returned by Wednesday noon [13th] neither the Doctor nor his
    letters can have passage this year. He also adds that George Verney
    wanted a letter under the King’s hand to the Emperor of Russia on
    behalf of John Scrope, to testify that he was of noble
    family. Writing again on the 13th, the same correspondent says, that the
    Emperor’s letter ran great danger of losing the opportunity of
    passage by the ships then ready to sail. These particulars supply
    the required dates, and enable us to fix a pretty lengthened period
    for Dee’s abode in Manchester, where his mother died 23 March,
    1604-5, the year of the plague. Allowing for eighteen years’ sojourn
    in Russia, the time for his return would be 1645, in which year we
    find that Czar Michael died.
    From an early period Dee had been captivated by the studies of
    his father, and retained his delight in them to his latter days. While
    at Moscow, he wrote in 1629, a work thus entitled : —
    Fasciculus Chymicus: abstrusæ Hermeticæ scientiæ ingressum,
    progressum, coronidem explicans ex selectissimis & celeberrimis
    Authoribus collectus & dispositus, ita ut omnibus instar speculi Philosophiæ
    habeatur ; à nemine hac methodo distributus. Parisiis, apud
    Nicolaum de la Viegn, 1631 : 12mo. (Manget’s Biblioth.)
    There is another edition, without date or place of printing, in the
    Bodleian Library. In 1650 it was translated by Elias Ashmole.
    Mrs. Dee died in Russia 6 July, 1634 (Sloane MS. fo. 11), after
    bearing to her husband seven sons and five daughters, who settled
    in different parts of Europe.
    “ On Dee’s return to England,” says the same MS. authority, from
    the relation of Rowland Dee, “ he was sworn Physician in Ordinary
    to King Charles the first. Afterwards he went to dwell at Norwich
    & there dyed about the year 1650 [September 1651] & lyes buried in
    St George’s Church at Norwich. His son Roland lived 8 years with
    his father in Russia.” Sir Thomas Browne in 1674 spoke of Dr. A.
    Dee as his old acquaintance, and gave Ashmole some memoranda
    about both father and son which were included in à Wood’s notice of
    the Dees. In strong affirmations the son assured the philosopher of
    Norwich of his father’s integrity and claims.

    This entry appears in print for the first time.
    Rowland Dee, called after his grandfather, was born early in
    1583, and was now therefore between seventeen and eighteen years
    of age. At the age of eight he had a narrow escape from drowning,
    having fallen over head and ears in the Thames at Mortlake. The
    above entry shews that his father had put him into the Grammar
    School, in the administration of which, the Wardens, according to
    the trust deed, were in many ways concerned. Dee’s visit on the
    5th August anteà was an official visit. One of the regulations
    was that a roll of names should be kept, and every third year be
    delivered to the Warden for the selection of those who were to
    have exhibition to Oxford or Cambridge. Rowland was probably of
    Brasenose College ; but of his subsequent history I have met with no
    trace.
    In 1581 the feoffees were : Sir John Byron, Knt. ; Alexander
    Radcliffe, Esq. ; Sir Edmund Trafford of Trafford, Knt. ; Sir John
    Radcliffe of Ordsall, Esq. ; Richard Holland of Denton, Esq. ; John
    Byron of Clayton, Esq. ; Alexander Barlow of Barlow, jun., Esq. ;
    Alexander Reddish of Reddish, Esq. ; Edmund Prestwich of Hulme,
    Esq. ; George Birch of Birch, gent. ; Robert Hyde of Denton,
    gent. ; Edmund Chadderton of Nuthurst, gent. ; James Chetham of
    Nuthurst, gent.; and William Culcheth of Newton, near
    Manchester, gent.

    Dee’s pecuniary embarrassments prevented him, for three years at
    least, from redeeming his plate. Edmund Chetham, the high master
    of the school, and brother of Humphrey Chetham the founder, made
    his will 28 Dec. 1602, and was buried at the Collegiate Church 21
    January following, being called “ Edward Cheetam Mr of Arts and
    scholemr of the ffree schole.” He appointed as his executor his
    father, Henry Chetham of Crumpsall, gentleman. From the will of
    the latter, made 6 March, 1602–3, and proved 4 May, in the same
    year, we learn from the following clause something more of Dee’s
    obligation : —
    “Itm. Whereas Mr John Dee Warden of the Colledge of Christ in
    Manchester heretofore borrowed of my sonne Edmund Cheetam
    deceased (whose executor I ame) the some of Ten Pounds and
    for securitie of repayment thereof and of lawfull consideracon
    for the forbearance of the same the saide Mr Dee delyvered to
    my saide sonne sixe seu’all p’cells of Plate to be keept as a payne
    or pledge for the same, wch by reason of my said executorshippe
    are now come to my possession. Now touchinge the same my
    Will is and I gyve to my said sonnes Humfrey and Raphe the
    said some of tenne pounds with all the saide consideracone due
    and to be due from the forbearance thereof and wth all
    advantages and p’fitts thereupon growinge or arisinge when and as
    the same shall or may be lawfullie gotten or obteyned.”
    The testator was buried at the Collegiate Church, 1 May, 1603.
    The metal value of Dee’s plate, weighing 48oz. (at 55. 2d. per oz.,
    the standard rate, 43 Eliz.), was £12. 8s.

    Adam Holland, who was of Newton, is mentioned in the Court
    Leet Records, and in the College Charter of 1578. He died in 1606,
    and was succeeded by his son Robert.
    Dee appears to have had abundance of plate. It is evident that
    the last few months of his stay at Manchester were harrassed by want
    of money. One is almost led to suspect that by some simoniacal
    arrangement the Warden was never in possession of the full revenue.

    Here the Diary abruptly ends. A few days after the
    last date Dee’s son Theodore, aged 13 years, died.
    This was the beginning of a series of misfortunes to the
    Old Warden. His life from this time to his death has
    hither to been presented in terms both vague and
    inexact ; and it may at some future time be dealt with
    here.
