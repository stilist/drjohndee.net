        of his Works, gives a large System of
        Prescriptions ordered against several Epidemics in his Day, in several
        Places of Europe, which were given at the Request of the Civil
        Magistrates, either by some eminent Physicians alone, or by
        Consultation and Advice of several whole Colleges ; as these for the
        Epidemic of Egrana, in 1564 ; for that of Dresden in 1566 ; and that of
        Jena, Anderac, and the Republic of Torgen in 1582 ; of Dresden in 1583 ;
        of Wirtenburg in 1598, 1609, 10, 18, 26 ; for Breslaw in 1607 ; for
        Francfort in 1611 ; for Berlin in 1625 ; for Tubingen in 1626, &c. which
        wanting both the History of the Air and Diseases, I have omitted.
      <p>
        Ludovicus Mercatus, chief Physician to Philip the <abbr>IId.</abbr> of
        Spain, gives us the History of an Epidemic, which happened in his Time,
        without Account of either Year or Weather ; it raged both in City and
        Country, and being scarce either seen or known before, was commonly
        called Garotillo, being a sudden fatal Tumour of the Throat and Jaws ;
        it was a short Continuance, and certain Danger ; it agreed neither with
        Quinsy nor French Pox, though it partook of the Nature of both ; for
        sometimes beginning with an Inflammation, it quickly ulcerated ; other
        times beginning with a corrosive Ulcer, with sudden and great Defluxion
        of putrid and malignant Humours, it became a Tumour, whose Matter
        quickly ate the Flesh to the Bones ; like that of a pestilential
        Carbuncle, it suffocated the Sick in a Day or two ; their Mouth and
        Breath stunk so intolerably, that none could come near them ; and a
        most malignang Fever attended it ; nothing was ever more malignant,
        dangerous, or suffocating. They had a Difficulty of breathing, and
        often of swallowing ; tho’ when the Mouth was wide opened, there was no
        visible Tumour to hinder it. They had a Pain of the Breast and Back, a
        suffocating Compression, with a pestilential Smell, and a most vehement
        Heat of all those Parts ; a redness of the Mouth and Neck, a drawing
        out of the Tongue, a Fault of Speech, with an insatiable Thirst, and
        most contagious withall ; all manifest Signs of a most terrible
        pestilential State, far beyond any Quinsy : They voided sanious Matter
        through their Mouth and Nose. The Ulcers were of sundry Colours, and
        most intolerably fetid. Some had the Glands swelled outwardly near the
        Neck, or below the Chin, and the whole Neck was swelled. The most
        successful remedies in a Quinsy were useless here, for the Syptoms
        still encreased, till they killed the third or fourth Day. Blood was
        let of grown-up Persons by Scarification and Cupping ; and of Children,
        with a Lancet the first Day ; then gave Alexipharmics in Food, Drink,
        and Physick. Within an Hour after Bleeding, they gave a Laxative ; then
        used a Gargle of strained Decoction of Barley, with Syrup and Vinegar
        of Roses ; or the acid Juice of Pomegrnates in Plantin Water, Roses and
        Pomegranate Bark, with Syrup of Roses and Mulberries : But a Decoction
        of Contragerra Root exceeded all. When the Heat was great, they used
        Rose Water with Vinegar of Roses ; or an Emulsion of the cold Seeds in
        Plantin Water, or sweet Almonds. When Repellents hindered not
        Ulceration and Corrosion, they used Driers and Alexipharmics, as
        Plantin, China Root, Scordium, Coriander Seeds, with a little Rose
        Vinegar : if these failed, gave them Allom Water. Lastly, they used
        <abbr>Ung.</abbr> Egyptiac.

      <blockquote><p>
        From the Middle of August to the End of September, raged a malignant
        epidemic Catarrh ; it began with a Pain of the Head, and Feverish Heat :
        Some were disposed to Sleep, others to Watching ; presently followed a
        dry Cough, Pain of the Breast, Haskness, and Roughness of the Throat,
        Weakness of the Stomach ; at last a terrible Panting for Breath, like
        dying Persons. Though the Cough lasted not long, yet the Panting for
        Breath continued to the 14th Day. Some sweated, such recovered the 30th
        or 40th Day ; they did not expectorate much. With some the Disease went
        off by Stool ; in others by Urine. Though all had it, few died in these
        Countries, except such as were let Blood of, or had unsound Viscera. Of
        the first died in Rome at this time 2000. The Cure consisted of
        repeated Lenitives, cooling Inciders, and Pectorals. In other Places it
        appeared somewhat different, according to varying Constitution of the
        Season.
      <p>
        In sundry Places it begun with a Weariness, Heaviness, and painful
        Sensation ; Heat and Horrours seized the whole Body, cheifly the Breast
        and Head, with a dry Cough, Hoarsness, Roughness of the Jaws,
        Difficulty of Breathing, Weakness, and Langour of the Stomach, Vomiting
        green Bile, like Juice of Leeks ; which Symptoms increased with the
        Disease, as the Fever, Cough, Weight and Pain of the Head, pricking
        Pain of the Extremes, Watching, Dryness, and Roughness of the Tongue,
        and Shortness of Breath. At the State of the Disease all these were
        heightened, Catarrh, Cough, Spitting. Some had Swellings on the Glands
        of the Throat. In some it went off by Stool ; in others by Urine or
        Sweat, or bleeding at the Nose. Some had Spots. With some it ended in a
        Pleurisy, Peripneumony, or Consuption ; All recovered very slowly. This
        Disease raged all over Europe at least, and prevailed for six Weeks.
        Yet if in any Place it was preceeded by a Drought, Bleeding gave the
        speediest and greatest Relief ; as at Montpelier, so as not one of a
        1000 died of it. The same Epidemic returned in October and November
        that Year ; then Bleeding, even in these Places, was hurtful, except
        when a spitting of Blood, Pleurisy, or Peripneumony attended it. At the
        same Time a Fever of the same kind prevailed, which
        <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sennert lang=la>Sennertus</a>
        says, reigned all over the World ; and was the
        same with that of 1551, as the Cattarh and Disorders of the Breast were
        the same with those of 15-0, 1591, 1597, 1610, &c. over all Europe,
        with a Rheum and Distillation from the Head, either with or without
        Fever, Pain of the Head, Heaviness, Hoarsness, Weakness . To those
        Symptoms this Year, were joined a Cough, Pain of the Jaws and Neck .
        Sinnertus, Forest, &c.—Says Reverius, after a prodigious Plague of
        Insects in April and May, the like Epidemic broke out and strangled
        many , but where proper Means were used, all recovered : It began with a
        Fever and Cough, then followed again a Pain of the Head, and Loins ;
        then the Fever intermitted a few Days, and returned with fresh Vigour.
        Some had no Rest, but the Heat increasing, they died , as some did of a
        Phrenzy, and others of a Consuption ; but speedy proper Means secured
        them, viz. Bleeding, Laxatives, and Pectorals, Cuppings, cooling
        Clysters, cordial Opiats, and Epithems.—Lastly, let us hear Christ.
        Math. From the Corruption, and Intemperature of the Air, arose an
        Epidemic, which travelled from E. and S. to W. and N. for in June it
        was in Sicily ; in July, in Rome and Italy ; in August, at Venice and
        Constantinople ; in September, in Hungary and upper Germany, Bohemia
        and Saxony ; in October, on all the Baltick Coast ; in November, in
        Norway ; in December, in Denmark, Sweden, Poland and Russia. It seized
        very speedily, so as all People were taken with an Ephemeris, or Cough,
        from a Defluxion of the Breast. Many before who had been ill of
        Diseases of the Breast, died. In the End of July died of this Disease
        in Rome, 4000 ; at Bremen, Brunswick, and Lunenburgh, an infinite
        Number ; in all Countries, Cities, and Families, scarce any but they
        were down at once ; only some were worse than others, according to the
        Diversity of Constitutions, Ages, Use of the Non-naturals, &c. Such as
        used no Medicines at all, came off better, sooner, and easier than such
        as did.—In the Summer and Harvest, says Balditius, raged an epidemic
        Disease, commonly called the Male del Castrone, or Moutone. From France
        it soon overspread all Italy ; it was a continual Fever for four or
        five Days, with a Pain of the Head, Straitness of the Breast, and
        Cough ; it was terminated by a profuse Sweat ; Bleeding and Purging were
        both hurtful, Sudorifics useful ; the Sick were allowed Wine, or Wine
        and Water to drink ; few died of it.

        The ſame malignant ſpotted Fever, which firſt appeared in Europe in
        <time datetime="1505">1505</time>,
        prevailed now again with its malignant contagious Conſtitution, from the
        ſame Cauſe; for the laſt Winter was wholly rainy and ſoutherly. The
        Spring the ſame, with very great and deſtructive Inundations, Darkneſs
        and Fogs, which killed the Buds of Trees, eſpecially the Olives. This
        Fever begun ſo mildly, that the Sick ſcarce perceived themſelves ill, or
        in need of a Phyſician before it was too late. Nor were Phyſicians
        themſelves leſs deceived, expecting a ſpeedy Criſis, but no ſuch thing.
        The Heat was not ſenſibly great, but the inward great Perturbation of the
        whole Body was manifeſt from its general and great Laſſitude, Dullneſs of
        the Senſes, ſupine lying in Bed, and heavy Headyneſs of the Sick. After
        the 4th or 7th Day they began to talk wildly; their Eyes were red and
        fiery. The Urine was firſt plentiful and whitiſh, then red and turbid;
        Pulſe low and ſlow; Excrements corrupt and fetid. On the 4th or 7th Day,
        little red Spots like Flea-bites began to appear on the Back, Arms, and
        Breaſt. Very little or no Thirſt; the Tongue was foul. Some were
        watchful, others very ſleepy, and ſome both in their Turns; ſome
        continued in this Condition to the 7th or 14th Day, or longer. Some had a
        Stoppage of Urine, which was a bad Sign. No Jews died of it. Some few
        Women and old People died of it; but it made ſad havock of Children and
        Youth, and thoſe of the richer ſort chiefly. All had a ſudden and great
        Loſs of Strength. A ſmall Laxative made a great Diſcharge. No Mitigation
        from a Criſis, great Loſs of Blood at the Noſe, difficult Eruption
        ſuddenly diſappearing, a livid Colour of the Spots, or a Stoppage of
        Urine, were all bad Signs; and the contrary were good. Great and fatal
        was the Diſſention, of Phyſicians about the Cure; ſome were for bleeding
        of all freely; but others ſtrictly obſerving tht all that were Blood of
        died, would let none. Others took the middle Way, and ordered
        Blood-letting ſparingly at firſt, of plethoric or ſanguine People only;
        and ſo about other Evacuations and Diet. But the beſt Method was a
        middling Diet, and boiled Water given to drink, or Water with a little
        Vinegar, or with Cinnamon, and a little Syrup of Wood Sorrel. They kept
        the Air in the Rooms of the Sick, clear and good; or perfumed by burning
        Herbs and Gums. After the ſecond Day none were let Blood, but were
        cupped, or had the Saphena, or Hemorrhoidal Veins opened. Where the Body
        was full of groſs Humours, they gave Caſſia, Manna, or Syrup of pale
        Roſes, or with Agaric. About the Eruption, of the Puſtules came out
        ſlowly, they gave Scordium, Trifol. Odorat. but no ſtrong Sudorifics.
        They uſed powerful Diuretics. All hot Things given, added to the Fever,
        encreaſed its Danger and bad Symptoms.
