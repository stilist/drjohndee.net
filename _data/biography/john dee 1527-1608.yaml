      There is perhaps no learned author in history who
    has been so persistently misjudged, nay, even
    slandered, by his posterity, and not a voice in all the
    three centuries uplifted even to claim for him a fair
    hearing. Surely it is time that the cause of all this
    universal condemnation should be examined in the
    light of reason and science ; and perhaps it will be
    found to exist mainly in the fact that he was too far
    advanced in speculative thought for his own age to
    understand. For more than fifty years out of the
    eighty-one of his life, Dee was famous, even if suspected
    and looked askance at as clever beyond human inter-
    pretation. Then his Queen died. With the narrow-
    minded Scotsman who succeeded her came a change in
    the fashion of men’s minds. The reign of the devil and
    his handmaidens—the witches and possessed persons—was
    set up in order to be piously overthrown, and the
    very bigotry of the times gave birth to indepen-
    dent and rational thought—to Newton, Bacon, Locke.
      But Dee was already labelled once and for all.
    Every succeeding writer who has touched upon his
    career, has followed the leaders blindly, and has only
    cast another, and yet another, stone to the heap of
    obloquy piled upon his name. The fascination of his
    psychic projections has always led the critic to ignore
    his more solid achievements in the realms of history
    and science, while at the same time, these are only
    cited to be loudly condemned. The learned
    Dr. Meric Casaubon, who, fifty years after Dee’s
    death, edited his Book of Mysteries—the absorbing
    recital of four out of the six or seven years of his
    crystal gazing—was perhaps the fairest critic he yet
    has had. Although he calls Dee’s spiritual revelations
    a “ sad record,” and a “ work of darkness,” he con-
    fesses that he himself, and other learned and holy men
    (including an archbishop), read it with avidity to the
    end, and were eager to see it printed. He felt certain,
    as he remarks in his preface, that men’s curiosity
    would lead them to devour what seems to him “ not
    parallelled in that kind, by any book that hath been
    set out in any age to read.” And yet on no account
    was he publishing it to satisfy curiosity, but only “ to
    do good and promote Religion.” For Dee, he is per-
    suaded, was a true, sincere Christian, his Relation
    made in the most absolute good faith, although
    undoubtedly he was imposed upon and deluded by the
    evil spirits whom he sometimes mistook for good ones.
      It may be well here to remark that this voluminous
    Book of Mysteries, or True and Faithful Relation
    (fol. 1659), from which in the following pages there
    will be found many extracts, abounds in tedious and
    unintelligible pages of what Casaubon calls “ sermon-
    like stuff,” interspersed with passages of extraordinary
    beauty. Some of the figures and parables, as well as
    the language used, are full of a rare poetic imagery,
    singularly free from any coarse or sensual symbolism.
    Like jewels embedded in dull settings, here and there
    a gem of loftiest religious thought shines and
    sparkles. There are descriptive touches of costume
    and appearance that possess considerable dramatic
    value. As the story is unfolded in a kind of spiritual
    drama, the sense of a gradual moving development, and
    the choice of a fitting vehicle in which to clothe it, is
    striking. The dramatis personam, too, the “ spiritual
    creatures ” who, as Dee believed, influence the
    destinies of man, become living and real, as of course
    they were to the seer. In many respects these
    “ actions ” were an exact counterpart of the dealings
    inaugurated by psychical scientists 275 years later, if
    we omit the close investigation for fraud.
      Casaubon’s successor in dealing with the shunned
    and avoided subject of John Dee was Thomas Smith,
    Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, who, in 1707,
    wrote the first connected Life of him, in a book of the
    Lives of Learned Men.1 It was based upon some of
    Dee’s autobiographical papers, and out of a total of a
    hundred pages, gave fifty to letters already printed
    by Casaubon.
      After this no sustained account of Dee’s romantic
    career is to be found outside the pages of biographical
    dictionaries and magazine articles, or among writers
    upon necromancy, hermetic philosophy, and alchemy.
    Many of these decorate their collections with apocry-
    phal marvels culled from the well-worn traditional
    stories of Dee and his companion, Edward Kelley.
    Thus, throughout his lifetime and since, he has con-
    tinued to run the gauntlet of criticism. “ Old impos-
    turing juggler,” “ fanatic,” “ quack,” are mild terms :
    in the Biographia Britannica he is called “ extremely
    credulous, extravagantly vain, and a most deluded
    enthusiast.” Even the writer on Dee in the Dictionary
    of National Biography says his conferences with the
    angels are “ such a tissue of blasphemy and absurdity
    that they might suggest insanity.” Many more such
    summary verdicts might be quoted, but these will
    suffice for the present.
      It has been said that no Life of Dee exists. And
    yet the materials for such a Life are so abundant that
    only a selection can be here used. His private diary,
    for instance, if properly edited, would supply much
    supplementary, useful, and interesting historical
    information.
      It is the object of this work to present the facts of
    John Dee’s life as calmly and impartially as possible,
    and to let them speak for themselves. In the course
    of writing it, many false assertions have disentangled
    themselves from truth, many doubts have been
    resolved, and a mass of information sees the light
    for the first time. The subject is of course hedged
    about with innumerable difficulties ; but in spite of
    the temptations to stray into a hundred bypaths, an
    endeavour has been strictly made to do no more than
    throw a little dim light on the point where the paths
    break off from the main road. If, at the end of the
    way, any who have persevered so far, feel they have
    followed a magnetic and interesting personality, the
    labour expended will not have been in vain. With
    a word of apology to serious historical readers for the
    incorrigibly romantic tendency of much of the narra-
    tive, which, in spite of the stern sentinel of a literary
    conscience, would continually reassert itself, the story
    of our astrologer’s strange life may now begin.

      John Dee was the son of Rowland Dee ; he was
    born in London, according to the horoscope of his
    own drawing, on July 13, 1527.
      His mother was Jane, daughter of William Wild.
    Various Welsh writers have assigned to Dee a genea-
    logical descent of the highest antiquity, and the
    pedigree1 which he drew up for himself in later life
    traces back his family history from his grandfather,
    Bedo Dee, to Roderick the Great, Prince of Wales.
    All authorities agree that Radnor was the county
    from whence the Dees sprang.
      Rowland Dee, the father, held an appointment at
    Court, as gentleman server to Henry ⅤⅠⅠⅠ., but was
    very indifferently treated by the King. This may partly
    account for the persistence with which Dee exhibited
    before Queen Elizabeth his claims to preferment at her
    hands. To be in habitual attendance at Court in those
    days, however, bred in men a great desire for place,
    and a courtier was but a mendicant on a grand scale.
      The boy, John Dee, was early bred in “ grammar
    learning,” and was inured to Latin from his tender
    years. Perhaps he was not more than nine or ten
    when he was sent to Chelmsford, to the chantry
    school founded there seven years before the great
    school at Winchester came into existence. The
    master who presided over Dee’s school hours in
    Essex was Peter Wilegh, whom the chantry com-
    missioners in 1548 reported as a man “ of good con-
    versation ” who had kept the school there for sixteen
    years. Dee has always been claimed by the Grammar
    School at Chelmsford as one of their most famous
    alumni, whose extraordinary career with its halo of
    mystery and marvel they perhaps feel little qualified
    to explore. Dee’s testimony that at Chelmsford he
    was “ metely well furnished with understanding of
    the Latin tongue ” is an unconscious tribute to Peter
    Wilegh’s teaching.
      In November, 1542, Dee, being then fifteen years
    and four months old, left Chelmsford to enter at St.
    John’s College, Cambridge, where, as he tells us in his
    autobiography, he soon became a most assiduous
    student.1 " In the years 1543, 1544, 1545, I was so
    vehemently bent to studie, that for those years I did
    inviolably keep this order : only to sleep four houres
    every night ; to allow to meate and drink (and
    some refreshing after) two houres every day ; and
    of the other eighteen houres all (except the tyme
    of going to and being at divine service) was spent
    in my studies and learning.” Early in 1546 he
    graduated B.A. from St. John’s College. At the
    close of the same year, Trinity College was founded
    by Henry ⅤⅠⅠⅠ., and Dee was selected one of the
    original Fellows. He was also appointed under-
    reader in Greek to Trinity College, the principal
    Greek reader being then Robert Pember. The
    young Fellow created the first sensation of his
    sensational career soon after this by arranging some
    mechanism for a students' performance of the Εἰρήνη
    (Eirene — Peace) of Aristophanes, in which he
    apparently acted as stage manager and carpenter.
      For this play he devised a clever mechanical and
    very spectacular effect. Trygseus, the Attic vine-
    dresser, carrying a large basket of food for himself,
    and mounted on his gigantic beetle or scarab (which
    ate only dung), was seen ascending from his dwelling
    on the stage to enter the palace of Zeus in the clouds
    above. One has only to think of the scenic effects
    presented by Faust and Mephistopheles at Mr. Tree’s
    theatre, for instance, to realise how crude and
    ineffective these attempts must have been ; but thirty
    or forty years before Shakespeare’s plays were written,
    so unusual an exhibition was enough to excite wild
    rumours of supernatural powers. We hear no more
    of theatrical performances, although several references
    in his after-life serve to show that his interest in the
    English drama, about to be born, lagged not far
    behind that of his greater contemporaries. He does
    mention, however, a Christmas pastime in St. John’s
    College, which seems to have been inspired by this
    same dramatic spirit. Of details wer are totally
    ignorant ; he only relates that the custom of electing
    a “ Christmas Magistrate ” was varied at his sugges-
    tion by crowning the chosen victim as Emperor. The
    first imperial president of the Christmas revels in
    St. John’s College “ was one Mr. Thomas Dunne, a
    very goodly man of person, stature and complexion,
    and well learned also,” evidently a presence fit for a
    throne. Dee adds : “ They which yet live and were
    hearers and beholders, they can testifie more than is
    meete here to be written of these my boyish attempts
    and exploites scholasticall.”
      He turned to sterner studies, and became a skilful
    astronomer, taking “ thousands of observations (very
    many to the hour and minute) of the heavenly
    influences and operations actual in this elementall
    portion of th eworld." These he afterwards published
    in various “ Ephemerides.”
      In May, 1547, Dee made his first journey abroad, to
    confer with learned men of the Dutch Universities
    upon the science of mathematics, to which he had
    already begun to devote his serious attention. He
    spent several months in the Low Countries, formed
    close friendships with Gerard Mercator, Gemma
    Frisius, Joannes Caspar Myricasus, the Orientalist
    Antonius Gogava, and other philosophers of world-
    wide fame. Upon his return to Cambridge, he
    brought with him two great globes of Mercator’s
    making, and an astronomer’s armillary ring and staff of
    brass, “ such as Frisius had newly devised and was in
    the habit of using.” These he afterwards gave to the
    Fellows and students of Trinity College ; he cites a
    letter of acknowledgment from John Christopherson
    (afterwards Bishop of Chichester), but upon search
    being made for the objects recently, through the kind-
    ness of the Master, it appears they are not now to be
    found. Dee returned to Cambridge in the year 1548
    to take his degree of M.A., and soon after went
    abroad. “ And never after that was I any more student
    in Cambridge.” Before he left, he obtained under the
    seal of the Vice-Chancellor and Convocation, April 14,
    1548, a testimonial to his learning and good conduct,1
    which he proposed to take with him abroad. Many
    times did he prove it to be of some value.
      In Midsummer Term, 1548, he entered as a student
    at the University of Louvain, which had been founde
    more than a hundred years before in this quaint old
    Brabantian town of mediaeval ramparts and textile
    industries. At Louvain, Dee continued his studies
    for two years, and here he soon acquired a reputation
    for learning quite beyond his years. It has been pre-
    sumed that he here graduated doctor, to account for
    the title that has always been given him.2 “ Doctor
    Dee ” certainly possesses an alliterative value not to
    be neglected. At Cambridge he was only M.A.
      Long after, when he had passed middle life, and
    when his remarkable genius in every branch of
    science had carried him so far beyond the dull wit of
    the people who surrounded him that they could only
    explain his manifestations by the old cry of “ sorcery
    and magic,” Dee made a passionate appeal to the
    Queen, his constant patron and employer, to send two
    emissaries of her own choosing to his house at Mort-
    lake, and bid them examine everything they could
    find, that his character might be cleared from the
    damaging charges laid against him. He prepared for
    these two commissioners, to whose visit we shall revert
    in its proper place, an autobiographical document
    of the greatest value, which he calls “ The Compen-
    dious Rehearsal of John Dee : his dutiful declaration
    and proofe of the course and race of his studious life,
    for the space of half an hundred years, now (by God’s
    favour and help) fully spent.”1 It is from this narra-
    tive that the facts of his early life are ascertainable.
    Perhaps we discern them through a faint mist of
    retrospective glorification for which the strange streak
    of vanity almost inseparable from attainments like
    Dee’s was accountable. But there is every reason to
    rely upon the accuracy of the mathematician’s story.
      “ Beyond the seas, far and nere, was a good opinion
    conceived of my studies philosophicall and mathema-
    ticall.” People of all ranks began to flock to see this
    wonderful young man. He gives the names of those
    who came to Louvain, a few hours’ journey from
    Brussels, where the brilliant court of Charles Ⅴ.
    was assembled, with evident pride. Italian and
    Spanish nobles ; the dukes of Mantua and Medina
    Celi ; the Danish king’s mathematician, Mathias
    Hacus ; and his physician, Joannes Capito ; Bohemian
    students, all arrived to put his reputation to the test.
    A distinguished Englishman, Sir William Pickering,
    afterwards ambassador to France, came as his pupil,
    to study astronomy “ by the light of Mercator’s globes,
    the astrolabe, and the astronomer’s ring of brass that
    Frisius had invented.” For his recreation, the
    teacher “ looked into the method of civil law,” and
    mastered easily the points of jurisprudence, even
    “ those accounted very intricate and dark.” It was
    at Louvain, no doubt, that his interest in the subject
    of alchemy became strengthened and fixed. Stories
    were rife of course of the famous alchemist, Henricus
    Cornelius Agrippa, who had died there, in the
    service of Margaret of Austria, only a dozen years
    or so before. Agrippa had been secretary to the
    Emperor Maximilian, had lived in France, London,
    and Italy, and Louvain, no doubt, was bursting with
    his extraordinary feats of magic.
      The two years soon came to an end, and a couple
    of days after his twenty-third birthday, young Dee
    left the Low Countries for Paris, where he arrived on
    July 20, 1550. His fame had preceded him, and
    within a few days, at the request of some English
    gentlemen and for the honour of his country, he
    began a course of free public lectures or readings in
    Euclid, “ Mathematicé, Physicé et Pythagoricé,” at
    the College of Rheims, in Paris, a thing, he says,
    which had never been done before in any university in
    Christendom. His audience (most of them older than
    himself) was so large that the mathematical schools
    would not hold them, and many of the students
    were forced in their eagerness to climb up outside the
    windows, where, if they could not hear the lecturer,
    they could at least see him. He demonstrated upon
    every proposition, and gave dictation and exposition.
    A greater astonishment was created, he says, than
    even at his scarabseus mounting up to the top of
    Trinity Hall in Cambridge. The members of the
    University in Paris at the time numbered over 4,000
    students, who came from every part of the known
    world. He made many friends among the professors
    and graduates, friends of “ all estates and professions,”
    several of whose names he gives ; among them, the
    learned writers and theologians of the day, Orontius,
    Mizaldus, Petrus Montaureus, Ranconetus (Ran-
    connet), Fernelius, and Francis Silvius.
      The fruit of these years spent in Louvain and Paris
    was that Dee afterwards maintained throughout his life
    a lively correspondence with professors and doctors in
    almost every university of note upon the Continent.
    He names especially his correspondents in the
    universities of Orleans, Cologne, Heidelberg, Stras-
    burg, Verona, Padua, Ferrara, Bologna, Urbino, Rome,
    and many others, whose letters lay open for the
    inspection of the commissioners on that later visit
    already alluded to.
      An offer was made him to become a King’s Reader
    in mathematics in Paris University, with a stipend of
    two hundred French crowns yearly, but he had made
    up his mind to return to England, and nothing would
    tempt him to stay. He received other proposals,
    promising enough, to enter the service of M. Babeu,
    M. de Rohan, and M. de Monluc, who was starting
    as special ambassador to the Great Turk, but his
    thoughts turned back to England, and thither, in
    1551, he bent his steps.
