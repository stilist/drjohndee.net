    NEWSAM, BARTHOLOMEW (d.
    1593), clockmaker to Queen Elizabeth, pro-
    bably born York, carried on business in
    London as a clockmaker, apparently from
    the date of Queen Elizabeth’s accession. He
    obtained from the crown a thirty years’ lease
    of premises in the Strand, near Somerset
    House, on 8 April 1565, and there he resided
    through life. He was skilled in his craft, and
    was on familiar terms with Sir Philip
    Sidney and other men of influence at court.
    About 1572 the post of clock-master to the
    queen was promised him on the death of
    Nicholas Ursea (Uriu, Vesea, or Orshowe).
    The latter had held the office under Queen
    Mary, and was reappointed to it by Queen
    Elizabeth. Newsam succeeded to the office
    before 1582. On 4 June 1583 he received,
    under the privy seal dated 27 May previous,
    ‘ 32s. 8d. for mending of clockes ’ during the
    past year. With the post of clockmaker he
    combined that of clock-keeper ; the two
    offices had been held by different persons
    in Queen Mary’s reign, and Newsam appears
    to have been the first Englishman appointed
    as clock-keeper.
      On 5 Aug. 1583 Newsam wrote ‘ to the
    ryghte honorable his very speciall good
    ffriend Sr ffrancis Walsingham, knighte’
    beseeching him ‘ to be mindfull unto her
    Matie of my booke concerninge my long and
    chargeable suite, wherein I have procured Sir
    Philipp Sidney to move you for th’ aug-
    mentinge of the yeares (if by any meanes
    the same may be);’ i.e. probably for an exten-
    sion of his lease of the house in the Strand.
    On 6 Sept. 1583, by letters patent, a lease
    for twenty-one years was granted to New-
    sam of lands ‘ at Fleete in Lincolnshire, for-
    merly the property of Henry, marquis of
    Dorset, late duke of Suffolk ; also a water-
    mill Wymondham, Norfolk, with fish-
    ings, &c., formerly property of the monastery
    of Wymondham … also all the weare of Llan-
    lluney, co. Pembroke, and two garden plots
    lying in Firkett’s Fields, in the parish of St.
    Clement Danes without Temple Bar,’ &c.
    The property in Pembroke had formerly be-
    longed to Jasper, duke of Bedford. Newsam
    also owned lands in Coney Street, in the
    parish of St. Martin, York (will). He died
    before 18 Dec. 1593, when his will was
    proved by Parnell, his widow. Her maiden
    name was Younge, and he had married her
    at the church of St. Mary-le-Strand on
    10 Sept. 1565. He left four children: Wil-
    liam (born 27 Dec. 1570), Edward, Mar-
    garet, and Rose. Edward, ‘ on condicion
    that he become a clockmaker as I am,’ was
    to have his father’s tools, except his ‘ best
    Vice save one, a beckhorne to stand upon
    borde, a greate fore-hammer, and [two]
    hand hammers, and a grete long beckhorne
    in my back shoppe : ’ all these were to go
    to John Newsam of York, a clockmaker, and
    presumably a relative.
      There is in the British Museum a striking
    clock made by Newsam, which is still in
    almost untouched condition. It is of gilded
    brass, richly engraved. It is very small, not
    more than four inches high, and contains a
    compass ; it has, of course, no pendulum,
    and but one hand. It is signed ‘ Bartil-
    mewe Newsum.’ The case is divided into two
    stories, the going train being in the upper,
    and the striking train in the lower story.
    Both the trains are arranged vertically, so
    that the clock is wound from underneath{.}
    The wheels are of iron, or perhaps steel,
    the plates and frames being of brass. It has
    fusees cut for catgut, which are long, and
    only slightly tapered. The hand is driven
    directly from the going fusee at right angles,
    by means of a contrate-wheel. The escape-
    ment is of the verge kind, and it has no
    balance-spring.
      The bequests in Newsam’s will confirm the
    evidence of his skill afforded by this clock.
    Mention is made there of ‘ a strickinge clocke
    in a silken purse, and a sonnedyall to stand
    upon a post in his garden ; ’ of ‘ a cristall
    Jewell with a watch in it garnished with
    goulde ; ’ of ‘ a sonnedyall of copper gylte ; ’
    of ‘ a watch gylte to shew the hower ; ’ of ‘ a
    great dyall in a greate boxe of ivory, with
    two and thirteth poyntes of the compos ; ’
    and of a ‘ chamber clocke of five markes
    price.’
