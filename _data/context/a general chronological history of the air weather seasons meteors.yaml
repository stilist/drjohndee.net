    Its fifth was April the 15th ; it broke
    out at Shrewſbury, and reigned in the North
    till the end of September ; it began in London
    July the 9th, 1551, and killed 800 the firſt
    Week in a few Hours. It now ſeized Engliſh
    Foreigners, but no Strangers here ; it carried
    off moſtly ſtrong People between 30 and 50
    Years of Age ; rarely touched Women,
    Children, or old People. If they were ſeized in
    their Sleep, they ſounded away, or died on
    their wakening.

    The ſame malignant ſpotted Fever, which
    firſt appeared in Europe in 1505, prevailed
    now again with its malignant contagious
    Conſtitution, from the ſame Cauſe ; for the laſt
    Winter was wholly rainy and ſoutherly. The
    Spring the ſame, with very great and
    deſtructive Inundations, Darkneſs and Fogs, which
    killed the Buds of Trees, eſpecially the Olives.
    This Fever begun ſo mildly, that the Sick
    ſcarce perceived themſelves ill, or in need of
    a Phyſician before it was too late. Nor were
    Phyſicians themſelves leſs deceived, expecting
    a ſpeedy Criſis, but no ſuch thing. The Heat
    was not ſenſibly great, but the inward great
    Perturbation of the whole Body was manifeſt
    from its general and great Laſſitude, Dullneſs
    of the Senſes, ſupine lying in Bed, and heavy
    Headyneſs of the Sick. After the 4th or 7th
    Day they began to talk wildly ; their Eyes
    were red and fiery. The Urine was firſt
    plentiful and whitiſh, then red and turbid ;
    Pulſe low and ſlow ; Excrements corrupt and
    fetid. On the 4th or 7th Day, little red
    Spots like Flea-bites began to appear on the
    Back, Arms, and Breaſt. Very little or no
    Thirſt ; the Tongue was foul. Some were
    watchful, others very ſleepy, and ſome both
    in their Turns ; ſome continued in this
    Condition to the 7th or 14th Day, or longer.
    Some had a Stoppage of Urine, which was a
    bad Sign. No Jews died of it. Some few
    Women and old People died of it ; but it
    made ſad havock of Children and Youth, and
    thoſe of the richer ſort chiefly. All had a
    ſudden and great Loſs of Strength. A ſmall
    Laxative made a great Diſcharge. No
    Mitigation from a Criſis, great Loſs of Blood at the
    Noſe, difficult Eruption ſuddenly
    diſappearing, a livid Colour of the Spots, or a Stoppage
    of Urine, were all bad Signs ; and the
    contrary were good. Great and fatal was the
    Diſſention, of Phyſicians about the Cure ; ſome
    were for bleeding of all freel y; but others
    ſtrictly obſerving tht all that were Blood
    of died, would let none. Others took the
    middle Way, and ordered Blood-letting
    ſparingly at firſt, of plethoric or ſanguine People
    only ; and ſo about other Evacuations and
    Diet. But the beſt Method was a middling
    Diet, and boiled Water given to drink, or
    Water with a little Vinegar, or with
    Cinnamon, and a little Syrup of Wood Sorrel. They
    kept the Air in the Rooms of the Sick, clear
    and good ; or perfumed by burning Herbs and
    Gums. After the ſecond Day none were let
    Blood, but were cupped, or had the Saphena,
    or Hemorrhoidal Veins opened. Where the
    Body was full of groſs Humours, they gave
    Caſſia, Manna, or Syrup of pale Roſes, or
    with Agaric. About the Eruption, of the
    Puſtules came out ſlowly, they gave Scordium,
    Trifol. Odorat. but no ſtrong Sudorifics. They
    uſed powerful Diuretics. All hot Things
    given, added to the Fever, encreaſed its
    Danger and bad Symptoms.

    Hoofs burnt and waſhed, (in Juice of Sorrel
    and Trefoil) each a Scruple ; Juniper Berries

    inſatiable Thirſt, and killed the 4th Day.
    Carbuncles, and itching black Puſtules came out on

    were uſed ; but Scarification and Cupping of
    the lower Parts, Leeches behind the Ears, and
    to the Hemorrhoidal Veſſels. But above all,

    of the Heart, Fainting, Delirium, Difficulty of
    Breathing, Cough, bloody Urine, Dyſentery,
    involuntary profuſe Tears, ſo as the cryſtaline
    Humour of the Eye was often loſt. Face and
    Body were firſt red, then quickly deformed
    with many Puſtules. The Pox appeared the
    fourth Day. On taking a Cordial, mild
    Diaphoretic, &c. the Fever and other Symptoms
    abated, except the Sick catched Cold, had a
    Looſeneſs, or were ſuffocated. The Diſeaſe
    prevailed as much in Harveſt as in Summer
    only it was milder. Tho. Bartholin. --- 1557,
    This Year and laſt was a great Scarcity of
    Corn from the paſt great Rains. It was a very
    unſeaſonable Year in England, all the Corn was
    choaked and blaſted, the Harveſt exceſſive
    wet and rainy ; before Harveſt this Year,
    Wheat was ſold at 4 Marks per Quarter, Malt
    at 44s. per Quarter, Peaſe at 46s. 8d. After
    Harveſt Wheat was ſold at 5s. per Quarter in
    London, 4s. in the Country. Malt at 6s. 8d.
    and in the Country at 4s. 8d. Rye at 3s. 4d.
    per Quarter in London, and in ſome Places at
    4d. per Buſhel. Clark’s Ex. --- Quartan Agues
    ſtill reigned fatally. In ſome more remote
    Countries, July, Auguſt, and September, were
    exceſſive hot and dry. In the End of September,
    came a very ſtrong cold North Wind ;
    preſently after were many Catarrhs, quickly
    followed by a moſt ſevere Cough, Pain of the
    Side, Difficulty of Breathing, and a Fever.
    The Pain was neither violent nor pricking, but
    mild. The 3d Day they expectorated freely.
    The 6th, 7th, or at the fartheſt the 8th Day ;
    all who had that Pain of the Side died ; but
    ſuch as were blooded the 1ſt or 2d Day,
    recovered on the 4th or 5th ; but bleeding on the
    laſt two Days, did no Service. Slippery,
    thickening, Linctuſes, were found of moſt Service.
    Broths, or Spoon-meats, or moiſt Foods were
    good. --- But where the Seaſon continued ſtill
    rainy, the Caſe was very different ; for at Mantua
    Carpentaria, three Miles from Madrid, the
    Epidemic began in Auguſt, and bleeding or
    purging was ſo dangerous, that in the ſmall
    Town 2000 were let Blood of, and all died.
    There it began with a Roughneſs of the Jaws,
    and ſmall Cough, then a ſtrong Fever, with a Pain
    of the Head, Back, and Legs ; ſome felt as tho’ they
    were corded over the Breaſt, and had a
    Weight at the Stomach ; all which continued
    to the 3d Day at fartheſt ; then the Fever went
    off with a Sweat, or bleeding at the Noſe. In
    ſome few it turned to a Pleuriſy, or fatal
    Peripneumony. --- At Alcmaria, this Year in
    October, raged ſuch an Epidemic, as ſeized whole
    Families at once. In that ſmall Place died in
    three Weeks 200 Perſons of this mortal
    Peripneumony. It attacked like a Catarrh, with a
    very ſlow and malignant Fever, bringing as it
    were a ſudden Suffocation along with it ;
    then ſeized the Breaſt with ſo great a
    Difficulty of Breathing, that the Sick ſeemed dying.
    Preſently it laid hold of the Precordia and
    Stomach, and with a violent Cough, which
    either cauſed Abortion, or killed gravid
    Women. Some, but very few, had continual
    Fevers along with it ; many had double Tertians ;
    other ſimple ſlight Intermittents. All were
    worſe by Night than by Day ; ſuch as
    recovered were long valetudinary, had a weak
    Stomach, and hypped. This Diſeaſe ſeized moſt
    Counties very ſuddenly when it entered,
    catching thouſands the ſame Moment. Thick
    ill ſmelling Fogs preceded it ſome Days. In
    ſome Places few recovered who had it
    accompanied with a violent Fever. Semitertians were
    next dangerous. If Intermittents accompanied
    the Pain of the Throat (which was neither a
    Quinzy, nor ſcarce a ſlight Inflammation, but
    only from a meer Defluxion, of which the Sick
    ſeemed choaked) they were better off, even
    without bleeding. But if the Fever
    ſupervened, and was not well managed, it was often
    fatal. Gentle bleeding the firſt Day was
    uſeful. For the Throat Gargles of Plantin,
    Scabious, and red Roſe Wafers, Quinces,
    Mulberries, and ſealed Earth, were uſed. For the
    Cough and Hoarſeneſs, pectoral and oyly
    Mixtures. Scarification with Cupping,
    ſucceeded better than bleeding. The Year 1555
    had been moſt exceſſively rainy, and 1556, as
    great a Drought --- After a great Scarcity of
    Corn, not from Famine, but the rich
    Cornmongers had bought and hoarded it up, till it
    was ſpoiled, which forced the Poor to eat
    Oxes and Swines Dung, &c. A ſudden and
    terrible Plague broke out between Delph and
    the Hague, in a ſmall Village, and ſpread
    over the whole Country in June, before the
    riſing of the Dog-Star. In Children it was
    attended with Spots. This Plague was
    preſaged by Stars, and Fire falling to the Ground
    on the Streets of Delph. Children in their
    Play digged Graves, and carried dead Coffins
    on their Shoulders ; ſung funeral Hymns like
    their Prieſts, and pretended to bury living
    Children their Playfellows. So great was this
    Mortality, that the Poor fought for Coffins
    for their dead Relations. Abortions, and Death
    of Childbed Women were common. This
    Plague continued till May 1558, and killed
    5000 of the Poor of Delph only. Dodoneus.

    A Dearth afflicted England ; Wheat ſold at
    55s. per Qnarter ; but a good and plentiful
    Crop this Harveſt brought it to 4s. or 5s. ----
    September the 7th, ſeven a Clock at Night, in a
    black rainy Cloud in the Weſt was ſeen a
    Rainbow, the Moon in the Eaſt, ſhining bright, and
    at full the Day before. In September exceſſive
    Rains, and a great Death, chiefly of Prieſts.
    Baker’s Chron.--- At Numigen, in July, raged
    an Epidemic, which ſpared none, and ſo cruel
    that it carried off many the 4th, 7th or 14th
    Day. It ſeized with a Fever, Roughneſs, or
    burning Inflammation of the Throat, and the
    Fever continual. The Sick were afflicted with
    a grievous Pain of the Head, taring Cough,
    and conſtant ſevere Pain of the Loins, that
    they couldd not walk ; and ſo large a Diſcharge
    by the Noſe, as would ſcarce ſuffer them to
    breath. Such as eſcaped by Bleeding,
    Pectorals, and a ſtinking Sweat ſupervening, had
    their entire Strength in all Parts continue. But
    ſuch as ſunk under the Fever, and want of
    Eating, becoming weak, all died. Wherefore
    the Cure turned on the Uſe of ſpeedy
    Univerſals, recalling the Appetite, keeping the
    Veſſels of the Throat open. Lenitives only were
    uſed, ſtrong Purges being fatal. --- In Harveſt
    a peſtilential Fever raged in France, and
    carried off many. Dyſenteries, with a ſlight
    Fever prevailed at the ſame Time ; but by the
    early Uſe of Rhubarb, all had their Gripes
    appeaſed, and recovered. Rever. Holer. &c. This
    Year there was a great Flood in the ſouth of
    Languedoc, with ſo dreadful a Tempeſt, that
    People imagined it was the laſt Day. Vignier.
    The rapid Deſcent of the Waters about
    Niſmes, removed divers Heaps and Mountains

    Silver Coins, Plate, and other valuable Veſſels,
    ſuppoſed to be hid in the Gothiſh Invaſion.

    Within a Mile of Nottingham was a
    grievous Tempeſt with Thunder, which, as it
    came through two Towns, beat down the
    Churches and all the Houſes, caſt the Bells to
    the Outſide of the Church Yard, and twiſted
    the Sheets of Lead like a Pair of Gloves,
    threw them 400 Foot into the Field. The
    Water and Mud of the Trent between them was
    taken up, carried a quarter of a Mile, and
    thrown in the Trees. Trees were torn up by
    the Roots ; Hailſtones that were 15 Inches
    about, fell down ; a Child was taken out of a
    Womans Arms, and carried up into the Air,
    then let fall, had its Arm broken and died ;
    ſix Men were killed, yet had neither Fleſh nor
    Skin hurt. This Year and laſt, Quartans
    were epidemic and fatal, killed many old
    People, eſpecially Divines ; great Numbers of
    Pariſhes were unſerved. Now another great
    Scarcity of Corn from want of Workers to
    get it ; Corn 14s. per Quarter. This was a
    cold Winter with a North Wind ; a ſoutherly
    rainy Spring ; an exceſſive hot Summer. In
    Harveſt Dyſenteries broke out in France and
    Paris. In Holland Semitertians acted the ſame
    Tragedy on the Rich that the Plague did on
    the Poor laſt Year. —-- All the Spring,
    Summer, and Harveſt, (ſays Jul. Palmer.
    Conſtantin.) being hot and dry, all Europe was
    grievouſly afflicted with ſundry Fevers, eſpecially
    Intermittents, and theſe very long, but not ſo
    mortal. There were alſo other Diſtempers at
    the ſame Time, as Dyſenteries, Stranguries,
    Ophthalmias, conſumptive Diſorders, &c.---In
    September, while Charles the Vth lay on his
    Death-bed, a blazing Star appeared in Spain,
    dim at firſt, but with the Encreaſe of his

    There died and
    ſickened quickly in Oxfordſhire 300 and odd ; in
    other Places died above 200 before Auguſt the
    12th ; after which no more died, &c. Sennertus
    in Tom. 2d. of his Works, gives a large Syſtem
    of Preſcriptions ordered againſt ſeveral
    Epidemics in his Day, in ſeveral Places of
    Europe, which were given at the Requeſt of the
    Civil Magiſtrates, either by ſome eminent
    Phyſicians alone, or by Conſultation and
    Advice of ſeveral whole Colleges ; as theſe for
    the Epidemic of Egrana, in 1564 ; for that
    of Dreſden in 1566 ; and that of Jena, Anderac,
    and the Republic of Torgen in 1582 ; of
    Dreſden in 1583 ; of Wirtenburg in 1598,
    1609, 10, 18, 26 ; for Breſlaw in 1607 ; for
    Francfort in 1611 ; for Berlin in 1625 ; for
    Tubingen in 1626, &c. which wanting both
    the Hiſtory of the Air and Diſeaſes, I have
    omitted.
    Ludovicus Mercatus, chief Phyſician to
    Philip the IId. of Spain, gives us the Hiſtory of
    an Epidemic, which happened in his Time,
    without Account of either Year or Weather ;
    it raged both in City and Country, and being
    ſcarce either ſeen or known before, was
    commonly called Garotillo, being a ſudden
    fatal Tumour of the Throat and Jaws ; it was
    a ſhort Continuance, and certain Danger ; it
    agreed neither with Quinſy nor French Pox,
    though it partook of the Nature of both ; for
    ſometimes beginning with an Inflammation, it
    quickly ulcerated ; other times beginning with
    a corroſive Ulcer, with ſudden and great
    Defluxion of putrid and malignant Humours, it
    became a Tumour, whoſe Matter quickly ate
    the Fleſh to the Bones ; like that of a
    peſtilential Carbuncle, it ſuffocated the Sick in a
    Day or two ; their Mouth and Breath ſtunk
    ſo intolerably, that none could come near
    them ; and a moſt malignant Fever attended
    it ; nothing was ever more malignant,
    dangerous, or ſuffocating. They had a Difficulty
    of breathing, and often of ſwallowing ; tho’
    when the Mouth was wide opened, there was
    no viſible Tumour to hinder it. They had a
    Pain of the Breaſt and Back, a ſuffocating
    Compreſſion, with a peſtilential Smell, and a
    moſt vehement Heat of all thoſe Parts ; a
    redneſs of the Mouth and Neck, a drawing
    out of the Tongue, a Fault of Speech, with
    an inſatiable Thirſt, and moſt contagious
    withal ; all manifeſt Signs of a moſt terrible
    peſtilential State, far beyond any Quinſy :
    They voided ſanious Matter through their
    Mouth and Noſe. The Ulcers were of ſundry
    Colours, and moſt intolerably fetid. Some had
    the Glands ſwelled outwardly near the Neck,
    or below the Chin, and the whole Neck was
    ſwelled. The moſt ſucceſſful remedies in a
    Quinſy were uſeleſs here, for the Syptoms
    ſtill encreaſed, till they killed the third or
    fourth Day. Blood was let of grown-up
    Perſons by Scarification and Cupping ; and of
    Children, with a Lancet the firſt Day ; then
    gave Alexipharmics in Food, Drink, and
    Phyſick. Within an Hour after Bleeding, they
    gave a Laxative ; then uſed a Gargle of
    ſtrained Decoction of Barley, with Syrup and
    Vinegar of Roſes ; or the acid Juice of
    Pomegrnates in Plantin Water, Roſes and Pomegranate
    Bark, with Syrup of Roſes and Mulberries ;
    But a Decoction of Contragerra Root exceeded
    all. When the Heat was great, they uſed Roſe
    Water with Vinegar of Roſes ; or an
    Emulſion of the cold Seeds in Plantin Water, or
    ſweet Almonds. When Repellents hindered
    not Ulceration and Corroſion, they uſed
    Driers and Alexipharmics, as Plantin, China Root,
    Scordium, Coriander Seeds, with a little Roſe
    Vinegar : if theſe failed, gave them Allom
    Water. Laſtly, they uſed Ung. Egyptiac.

    In 1578, and on April the 6th this Year,
    and May the 12th, were general Earthquakes
    over all England. October the 10th, a Comet
    in the South buſhing toward the Eaſt ; it
    continued from October to January, full two
    Months, Stow. ---- The Weather for ſome
    Years, paſt having been extraordinary moiſt,
    wet, and rainy, Wind South, at the Riſing of
    the Dog Star came a cold dry North Wind.
    From the Middle of Auguſt to the End of
    September, raged a malignant epidemic
    Catarrh ; it began with a Pain of the Head, and
    Feveriſh Heat : Some were diſpoſed to Sleep,
    others to Watching ; preſently followed a dry
    Cough, Pain of the Breaſt, Haſkneſs, and
    Roughneſs of the Throat, Weakneſs of the
    Stomach ; at laſt a terrible Panting for Breath,
    like dying Perſons. Though the Cough laſted
    not long, yet the Panting for Breath continued
    to the 14th Day. Some ſweated, ſuch recovered
    the 30th or 40th Day ; they did not
    expectorate much. With ſome the Diſeaſe went
    off by Stool ; in others by Urine. Though all
    had it, few died in theſe Countries, except
    ſuch as were let Blood of, or had unſound
    Viſcera. Of the firſt died in Rome at this Time
    2000. The Cure conſiſted of repeated
    Lenitives, cooling Inciders, and Pectorals. In other
    Places it appeared ſomewhat different,
    according to varying Conſtitution of the Seaſon.
    In ſundry Places it begun with a
    Wearineſs, Heavineſs, and painful Senſation ; Heat
    and Horrours ſeized the whole Body, chiefly
    the Breaſt and Head, with a dry Cough,
    Hoarſneſs, Roughneſs of the Jaws, Difficulty
    of Breathing, Weakneſs, and Langour of the
    Stomach, Vomiting green Bile, like Juice of
    Leeks ; which Symptoms increaſed with the
    Diſeaſe, as the Fever, Cough, Weight and
    Pain of the Head, pricking Pain of the
    Extremes, Watching, Dryneſs, and Roughneſs of
    the Tongue, and Shortneſs of Breath. At the
    State of the Diſeaſe all theſe were heightened,
    Catarrh, Cough, Spitting. Some had Swellings
    on the Glands of the Throat. In ſome it went
    off by Stool ; in others by Urine or Sweat, or
    bleeding at the Noſe. Some had Spots. With
    ſome it ended in a Pleuriſy, Peripneumony,
    or Conſuption ; All recovered very ſlowly.
    This Diſeaſe raged all over Europe at leaſt,
    and prevailed for ſix Weeks. Yet if in any
    Place it was preceeded by a Drought, Bleeding
    gave the ſpeedieſt and greateſt Relief ; as at
    Montpelier, ſo as not one of a 1000 died of
    it. The ſame Epidemic returned in October
    and November that Year ; then Bleeding, even
    in theſe Places, was hurtful, except when a
    ſpitting of Blood, Pleuriſy, or Peripneumony
    attended it. At the ſame Time a Fever of the
    ſame kind prevailed, which Sennertus ſays,
    reigned all over the World ; and was the ſame
    with that of 1551, as the Cattarh and
    Diſorders of the Breaſt were the ſame with thoſe
    of 1510, 1591, 1597, 1610, &c. over all
    Europe, with a Rheum and Diſtillation from the
    Head, either with or without Fever, Pain
    of the Head, Heavineſs, Hoarſneſs, Weakneſs .
    To thoſe Symptoms this Year, were joined a
    Cough, Pain of the Jaws and Neck.
    Sinnertus, Foreſt, &c.---Says Reverius, after a
    prodigious Plague of Inſects in April and May,
    the like Epidemic broke out and ſtrangled
    many , but where proper Means were uſed,
    all recovered : It began with a Fever and Cough,
    then followed again a Pain of the Head, and
    Loins ; then the Fever intermitted a few Days,
    and returned with freſh Vigour. Some had
    no Reſt, but the Heat increaſing, they died ;
    as ſome did of a Phrenzy, and others of a
    Conſuption ; but ſpeedy proper Means
    ſecured them, viz. Bleeding, Laxatives, and
    Pectorals, Cuppings, cooling Clyſters, cordial
    Opiats, and Epithems. --- Laſtly, let us hear
    Chriſt. Math. From the Corruption, and
    Intemperature of the Air, aroſe an Epidemic,
    which travelled from E. and S. to W. and N.
    for in June it was in Sicily ; in July, in Rome
    and Italy ; in Auguſt, at Venice and
    Conſtantinople ; in September, in Hungary and upper
    Germany, Bohemia and Saxony ; in October, on all
    the Baltick Coaſt ; in November, in Norway ;
    in December, in Denmark, Sweden, Poland and
    Ruſſia. It ſeized very ſpeedily, ſo as all
    People were taken with an Ephemeris, or Cough,
    from a Defluxion of the Breaſt. Many
    before who had been ill of Diſeaſes of the Breaſt,
    died. In the End of July died of this Diſeaſe
    in Rome, 4000 ; at Lubec, in October, 8000 ;
    at Hamburg 3000 ; at Bremen, Brunſwick,
    and Lunenburgh, an infinite Number ; in all
    Countries, Cities, and Families, ſcarce any but
    they were down at once ; only ſome were
    worſe than others, according to the Diverſity
    of Conſtitutions, Ages, Uſe of the
    Non-naturals, &c. Such as uſed no Medicines at all,
    came off better, ſooner, and eaſier than ſuch as
    did. --- In the Summer and Harveſt, ſays
    Balditius, raged an epidemic Diſeaſe,
    commonly called the Male del Caſtrone, or
    Moutone. From France it ſoon overſpread all
    Italy ; it was a continual Fever for four or
    five Days, with a Pain of the Head,
    Straitneſs of the Breaſt, and Cough ; it was
    terminated by a profuſe Sweat ; Bleeding and
    Purging were both hurtful, Sudorifics uſeful ;
    the Sick were allowed Wine, or Wine and Water
    to drink ; few died of it.
    In Grand Cairo 500000 died of the Plague
    in ſix or ſeven Months Time ; it came into
    Egypt from Barbary, which is always the
    fataleſt Plague that enters Egypt, far exceeding
    that from Greece or Syria, which are the only
    three Places whence they have it. It never
    viſits this Country before the latter End of
    September, or Beginning of October ; nor
    continues longer than the Beginning of June ;
    when not only it, but its Contagion is ſaid to
    ceaſe ; ſo that after that, all Infection from
    Cloaths, Houſes, Perſons, Furniture, &c.
    diſcontinues. The ſooner it comes, the ſeverer,
    more fatal, and durable it is ; the later, the
    milder, leſs diffuſive, and ſhorter it is. Of all
    Places in the World, it makes the greateſt
    Havock of People in Grand Cairo, and the Banks
    of the Caleg ; yet the Sick are beſt attended
    in it, and moſt Care taken of, from the
    Mahumedan Doctrine of abſolute Predeſtination,
    that the Number of particular individual
    Perſons ordained to die of this Diſeaſe, with their
    Time and Place of their Death is ſo fixed,
    that the Fate is irreſiſtible, and unavoidable ;
    hence the Sound and Infected live together,
    lye together ; no ſooner is one dead of it, than
    another healthy Perſon dreſſes with the Cloaths
    of the Deceaſed ; and when aF amily dieſ of
    it, their whole Cloaths, and other Goods and
    Furniture, are next Day brought to the open
    Market, and readily ſold off. --- At
    Alexandria many peſtilential mortal Fevers
    abound in the Autumn. Strangers are ſooner
    infected, and in greater Danger from them,
    than the Natives. The Urine, Pulſe, and
    febrile Heat of the Sick differ very little, if at
    all, from the ſame in healthy State. They
    are commonly known thus : They begin with
    much bilious virulent Vomitings, with a
    torturing Pain, and cannot keep any Food on
    their Stomach ; they have conſtant Toſſings and
    Reſtleſneſs, and many have a Looſneſs of thin,
    bilious, moſt fetid Stools of ſundry Colours ;
    they loath Food, and though their Tongues
    are parched, rough, and black, yet they have
    little Thirſt. Beſides the Plague of Cairo, and
    Yearly Fever of Alexandria, the Egyptians
    have ſeveral Epidemics, as Inflammations of
    the Eyes, Leproſy, Elephantiaſis, moſt ſudden
    and fatal Phrenzies, moiſt peſtilent Small Pox,
    Arthritic Pains, all Kinds of Catarrhs, Hernias,
    Stone, Conſumptions, Obſtructions of the
    Abdiminal Viſcera, Weakneſs of the Stomach ;
    Tertian, ardent, hectic, and peſtilential Fevers.
    Of all the Nations, they formerly uſed
    Scarifications of the Legs moſt, and with greateſt
    Succeſs. They did it thus : They handle and
    nib the Parts well, then ſet them in a large
    Veſſel of warm Water, and pour the Water
    often on them with their Hands, and gently
    whip them with ſmall Reeds ; all which they
    repeat ; then tie them under the Ham with a
    Leathern Garter, then rub and handle them
    in the Water, and whip till they are are red ;
    by this Time the Parts are ſtupified that the
    Sick feel little Pain from the Scarifications ;
    then beginning above the Tendo Achillis, they
    ſcarify pretty deep, according to the
    longitudinal Direction of the muſcular Fibres : In the
    firſt Story they make two longitudinal
    Inciſions ; in the ſecond they make three or four ;
    and in the three other Stories, five Slaſhes
    apiece all the Height of the Calf of the Leg :
    This done, they let them ſtand in the Water,
    and waſh and rub all the while ; if they uſe
    it for a particular Place, they ſcarify only one
    Calf ; if for Evacuation, as in a Fever, they
    take both : The common Number of Inciſions
    made in the five Stories on each Leg, is from
    20 to 40, according to the Age and Strength
    of the Sick. Some in their Plague make three
    or four large Wounds in their Calf, each four
    Fingers breadth long, and keep them open
    till the Fever is gone. From theſe Scarifications,
    they take from one to two Pound of Blood ;
    then looſe the Garter, waſh the Legs, rub
    them well down with their Hands dipt in
    Oyl, wrap them up, and in three or four Days
    the Legs are well. They uſe this
    Scarification in all putrid Fevers. This greatly relieves
    the Head, ſo as they ſeldom have violent or
    continual Pains, Watchings, Delirium, Phrenzy,
    or the like. Nor are the Hypochonders ſo much
    diſtended or inflamed. Nor are they ſo liable to
    Toſſings, Reſtleſneſs, Anxiety, Difficulty of, or
    Catching for their Breath, Symptoms too common
    in acute, malignant, peſtilential Fevers ;
    they uſe it in all internal Inflammations, and
    for Childrens Inflammation of their Tonſils
    and Jaws. (But in Infants they ſcarify behind
    the Ears for the laſt.) In the Plague, they with
    good Reaſon, and great Succeſs, fly to the
    four or five deep Slaſhes to be kept open, as
    to the laſt and ſacred Anchor. They ſcarify
    alſo in chronic acute Pains, after Univerſals, and
    in every obſtinate Inflammation, either
    external, or in the Viſcera, on the Part affected, or the
    next to it ; and in Eryſipelas, in prodagric
    Pains, Tumours, and Ulcers, that cicatrice
    difficultly. In Defœdations of the Skin, in
    Bites of mad or venemous Beaſts, they ſtill
    retain the ancient and uſeful Practice of
    Inciſion, ſo much depended on by the Ancients,
    but too much neglected by modern and
    preſent Phyſicians. When they perform the
    Operation, they take a Piece of old Linnen, a
    Cubit long, and three Fingers broad, wrap in
    it a Piece of Goſypium, and with a Silk Thread
    tye it in Form of a Pyramid, and apply its
    broad End to the Part to be burnt, fix it well
    to the Place, put Fire to the narrow End,
    ſuffer it to burn till the Rag and Goſypium are
    burnt away ; and while the Skin is
    burning, they touch the Edges about with an Iron,
    that an Inflammation ariſe not from the Heat ;
    they always make a Hole in the middle of
    the Bundle for the Air to paſs ; when it is
    burned, they dreſs it with Marrow of Bones to
    haſten off the Eſchar, This is the Method of
    Egyptians, Arabians, and others living in Tents.
    They uſe it in all Chronic Pains of the Joynts,
    or other Parts which come from a Defluxion
    of cold Humours, or flatulent Tumours,
    Laxneſs or Weakneſs of the Parts. In the Sciatic,
    Gout of the Hands or Feet ; in all Defluxions
    from the Head, Breaſt, or Lungs, Diſeaſes of
    the Eyes ; in Epilepſies, Palſies, Apoplexies,
    Vertigos, Madneſs, Lethargy, Dulneſs,
    Fooliſhneſs ; they burn the hind Head, Forehead,
    Neck, behind both Ears. In moſt acute Pains
    of the Eyes, Ears, and Teeth, they burn the
    Temples ; as alſo in periodic Pains of the
    Teeth, and Putrefaction of the Gums and
    Teeth. In a Phthyſis and Empyæma, they burn
    the Breaſt, in cold, weak, flegmatic, flatulent
    Stomachs, for Hardneſs or Schirroſity of the
    Spleen, in a Dropſy, in Pains of the Back,
    Loins, Neck and Joynts, and for pituitous
    Tumours. The Uſefulneſs of theſe two
    Operations may apologize for giving the
    Manner nd Uſes of them from Proſp. Alpin. ---- A
    ſtrange Apparition was ſeen in Somerſetſhire,
    60 Perſonages all cloathed in black, a Furlong
    diſtant from their Spectators ; after their
    appearing and tarrying a little while, they

    This Summer having been exceſſively dry
    and hot, near the End of the Seaſon, a
    malignant enough Dyſentery broke out, raging
    far and near ; it continued all the Harveſt,
    chiefly afflicting Children, and ſeveral Adults ;
    who yet, by ſeaſonable and proper Remedies,
    recovered. Slight Evacuations with Rhubarb,
    and the like Clyſters, were profitable, with
    the Uſe of burnt Hartſhorn, and
    Armenian Bole. The Vulgar uſed Rumax Seeds.
    Wine was injurious becauſe of the Fever that
    attended it. Sometimes to check the
    immoderate Evacuation and Gripes, Opiats were

    Puſtules ; and it was not unlike, for Cupping,

    Shoulders or Legs, many were cured by the
    Eruption, or breaking of the Bladders. The

    In the Beginning of the Spring, Pleuriſies
    and Peripneumonies prevailed, not without
    ſome Suſpicion of Malignity ; they began
    with Shivering, and an intenſe Fever ; ſometimes a
    fear of Suffocation, as in a Peripneumony ;
    inſtead of this, ſome had ſhooting Pains in the
    Head, Shoulders, Hinds, and Feet ; and in the
    Loins, Sides, and Breaſt ; after Bleeding, they

    with ſuch Severity as though the Inteſtines
    were cut on both Sides. In theſe
    Difficulties, neither Bleeding, Laxative, nor
    Scarifications, nor other external or internal Remedies,

    ſevere, the Pulſe languid or intermittent. Some
    were delirious before they died. It was

    Antipleuritic Methods formerly, and in other
    Places found ſucceſſful, failing in this, it was

    and Harveſt (Auguſt excepted, which was fair)
    were exceſſive Rains, great Floods, which did
    ineſtimable Hurt ; Corn was very dear. In
    1595 and 1596, was great Scarcity and Dearth,
    with profound ſhocking Rains, and great
    Floods. There raged a ſore Famine over all
    Italy, and reached Germany, which forced
    People to eat uncommon and unwholſome Food,
    as green Hedge Crabs, Muſhrooms, Dogs, Cats,
    Reptiles, &c. In 1596 and 1597, in the
    Dioceſe of Cologn and Weſtphalia, in the Counties
    of Waldeck, Wittenſtein, Heſſen, &c. raged a
    malignant Fever, with Convulſions, Ravings,
    &c. with or without a Fever ; it ſeized in the
    following Manner, firſt the Sick felt a pricking
    or tickling like the Motion of Ants, under the
    Skin of their Feet or Hands, or ſometimes
    both ; ſometimes in one Side, ſometimes in
    both ; then ſuddenly their Fingers or Toes
    were violently contracted, or forcibly extended
    without Strength or Motion, as though they were
    ſtiff or frozen ; then the Convulſions
    roſe from the Hands and Feet to the Legs,
    Thighs, Hips, Arms, and Shoulders, and ſo to
    the reſt of the whole Body, till the Sick were
    either rolled together like a Hedgehog or Ball,
    or extended ſtiff at whole Length like a dead
    Corps or Piece of Wood. This Contraction
    or Extenſion continued in this manner during
    the whole Time of the Fit in ſome ; but it
    often ſeized them alternately, ſo that the
    Member juſt now extended and ſtiff, would
    preſently be rolled up like a Ball, and then
    inſtantly pulled and extended again. This
    Convulſion was often in the Hands only, or in the
    Arms, or in both ; frequently it was in the
    Mouth, Lips, Eyes, or whole Body. This
    Contraction laſted a long or ſhort Time, till its
    Cauſe was diſcuſſed or ſpent ; then the Joints
    were at reſt, till a new Steam or Vapour roſe
    to diſturb and twitch the Nerves afreſh. If the
    peſtilential Cauſe was in the Head, then the
    ſpinal Marrow being drawn into Conſent, the nervous
    Syſtem over the whole Body was
    violently contracted in a Moment ; but if in the
    Hands or Feet, or both, or in any one Part,
    then they only were contracted or extended.
    So excruciating and terrible was the Pain
    attending theſe Convulſions, that the hideous
    piercing Screighs of the Sick, were heard nine
    or ten Houſes off in Villages, and at a great
    Diſtance in the Field, ſo as Byſtanders could
    not bear to hear them. Their conſtant
    Outcry was to have the contracted Part extended,
    or the extended Part contracted. The Sick
    felt either a Senſe of Cold, like Ice Water ; or
    of Heat, like Fire running over their whole
    Body ; hence ſeveral fell into burning Fevers.
    The Diſeaſe gave not the leaſt previous Notice
    of its Seizure ; ſo ſudden was it, that ſome
    were ſtruck at Table eating, ſome at Plow,
    ſome in the Fields, ſome in the Woods, or any
    other Buſineſs : Some at firſt threw up much
    Water or Flegm, without any Complaint of
    their Stomach or Belly. When the Diſtemper
    began in the extreme Parts, it reſted in them
    only, without attacking the Head for ſix, eight,
    or ten Days ; nay, in ſome for ſome Weeks, or
    Months, if fit Remedies were uſed ; but if
    neglected, it got to the Head, and became a
    terrible and fatal Epilepſy, of which many
    laid as dead for ſix or eight Hours ; and
    except taken in the Evening, many were buried
    in the Fit. Several it rendered fooliſh, ſtupid,
    lethargic, or delirious ; the Flegmatic were all
    lethargic, or became fooliſh, threw their Food
    on the Dunghil, their Excrements in the
    Room where they laid, and thruſting their
    Cloaths, or what came in their Way, into
    them. This Sillyneſs continued three or four
    Days or longer. The Melancholy were
    fearful, waked out of their Sleep with Frights,
    and deſiring Solitude, got out of Bed, either
    naked or in their Shirts, run into Fields,
    Woods, or Rivers, and lurked there, till by
    Craft they were ticed back. The Bilious and
    Sanguine being angry, furious and impatient,
    ruſhed in upon their Neighbours, would find
    ſome body that they reputed a Beaſt or Devil,
    and hated, and curſe the Byſtanders ; ſome
    plucked the Eyes out of their Parents or
    Relations Heads ; many were ſo mad, that there
    was a Neceſſſity to chain them before they
    died. But ſuch as had a good Conſtitution
    before they fell ill, were not fierce, but only
    laughed, talked, were merry, or ſhowed
    Antics. Though all were delirious after the
    Epilepſy, ſome few were ſo before it. This
    Perturbation of Mind continued in ſome three or
    four or more Days ; in others a very long Time ;
    and though when come out of the Fit they
    returned to their former Mind, yet they lived,
    behaved, and Walked like drunken People,
    going with a high Step, and throwing their
    Legs ſtrangely and fooliſhly ; nor did they
    remember any Thing that had paſt in the
    Fit, nor complained of any paſt or preſent
    Pain of the Head. Theſe Doatings rarely went
    off without leaving ſome Taint or Mark, as
    Dulneſs of the Hearing, Tingling of the Ears,
    Dimneſs of Sight, and ſometimes both. Some
    were ſo weakened with the Diſeaſe, that they
    had no Uſe of the Parts, but were fed like
    Children. After the Fit, the Sick had a moſt
    voracious and inſatiable Appetite, and
    Longing for ſeveral Meats, as though their
    Hunger could never be ſatiſfied, nor they eat
    enough. When they had Plenty given them,
    they gorged down, and conſumed incredible
    Quantities, without any after Load,
    Compreſſion, or Uneaſineſs. In the Courſe of this
    Disſaſe, a Diarrhea began, and afflicted them
    till the whole morbific Matter was ſpent. The
    leſs they ate, the ſeverer the Looſneſs. Alſo
    in Proceſs of Time, the Hands and Feet of
    moſt ſwelled ; and on their Toes and Fingers,
    were great Bliſters full of Ichor, which being
    opened, much Water run down their Fingers
    without any Relief. Some had ſmall Sweats.
    All that had the Epilepſy, had Fits of it
    return as long as they lived. Such as doated,
    were delirious, raging, or furious, never
    recovered their former Judgment or Diſcretion,
    but were fooliſh, and ſilly, though they lived
    15 or 16 Years after. At the ſame Time of
    the Year, viz. in December and January, in
    the ſharp and cold froſty Winter, they fell
    ſuddenly into the ſame deplorable State, or run
    out into the Fields, or threw themſelves into
    Rivers, whereby many were loſt Yearly before
    they could be found. Though this Diſeaſe
    was neither eaſily cured, nor quickly
    overcome, yet where it had not taken deep Root,
    nor continued long, it was not only curable,
    but by proper Care, ſuch as had ſuffered long
    and much, might obtain ſuch a Truce, as
    rendered the Remainder of their Life
    comfortable. Few that lived in the ſame Houſe, and
    converſed freely with the Infected, eſcaped this
    terrible Contagion either in one Shape or
    another, as Dyſentery, Diarrhea, Convulſions, &c.
    But the Time of Infection was very different,
    according to the Conſtitution, and former Way
    of Life, as from one to twelve Months, or in
    ſome even at two Years End. Such as in
    Time had proper Remedies, moſtly recovered
    to their former State. The Diſeaſe, and all its
    Symptoms, were more frightful and fatal to the
    Poor than to the Rich ; to the Intemperate and
    Irregular, than to the Sober and Regular ; the
    laſt were alſo ſooner, eaſier, and fullier cured
    than the firſt. Publick Care was taken that
    all ſhould have ſufficient Diet of good Juice,
    and eaſy Digeſtion, as Beef, Veal, Mutton,
    Hens, Capons, Turkies, Partridges, Birds of
    Mountains and Woods, good Wheat, or
    Oatmeal, Apples, Pears, Prunes, or the like,
    boiled, and often taken with aromatic or
    carminative Herbs, either eaten in Sauces, Broths,
    or alone ; and either good Wine, or fine Ale
    to drink. They were to avoid Paſſions of
    Mind, Venery, Pork, Bacon, Beef of old
    Cattle, Fiſh of all Kinds, Peaſe, Beans, Nuts,
    Cheſnuts, raw Apples, or Pears, Onions,
    Muſtard, Garlick, Leeks, Horſe Raddiſh, Cheeſe,
    new, dead or ſtale Ale, corrupt or ſtagnant
    Waters, too rich or old Wines. They were to
    ſhun South Wind and Cold, and to procure clean
    warm dry Air, by burning in their Rooms
    Juniper, Lavender, Sage, Thyme, Maſtich,
    Frankincenſe, Betony, Roſemary, &c. The
    medicinal Courſe was begun with Laxatives, and the
    Body was to be kept open by one every 6th
    or 8th Day ; a Sweat was to be given once
    every Fortnight ; a Purge was given daily the
    firſt two or three Days, according to the
    Patient’s Strength and Age. Then they gave the
    Convulſive Powder ſix or ſeven Days ; then a
    Purge ; then the Powder again for 14 Days.
    But if the Cure was begun immediately before
    full or new Moon, they began with the
    Powder firſt ; then purged, and gave ſome Doſes
    of the Powder every Phaſe of the Moon for
    ſeveral Moons after, and repeated the whole
    Courſe every December and January as at
    firſt, and ſometimes a Sweat. The
    Preſcriptions for the Purge, convulſive Powder, and
    convulſive Antidote were, 1. The purging

    after the Purge, and at Night, ſeaſoned with
    wild Thyme, Savory, Roſemary, Sage ; and in
    December and January, for Prevention, beſides
    the convulſive Powder, they uſed Peony Roots,
    Elecampane, Sage, Rue, Juniper-berries,
    Cummin Seeds, &c. --— For the Cure of the
    Symptoms ; 1. Hunger : They gave often, and
    ſparingly, of the above Meats, very fat. If the
    Stomach was acid, or pall’d with much Phlegm,
    they gave a mild Peuk. 2. Vomiting: If from
    too much Food, it was allowed more
    ſparingly ; if from a Load of bad Humours there, it
    was not ſtopt ſuddenly, except it occaſioned
    Weakneſs, then they applied a Pultice of Wine,
    Rye Bread, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Cloves, and
    Quinces ; and gave for Drink, Wheat Bread
    Toaſt, rubb’d with Nutmeg, and dipt in Wine,
    with Sugar. --- 3. Looſneſs : This was by no
    means to be quickly ſtopt, but rather to be
    encouraged ſome Days by the Uſe of the two
    firſt Electuaries, either till it ceaſed, or
    weakened the Perſon ; then they uſed Steel very
    often heated, and quenched in their Drink, or
    Rice Gruel, or Milk, and Quinces, or
    preſerved or dried Sloes, or a Dram of ſealed Earth,
    Bole, Nutmeg, or burnt Hartſhorn, &c.-----
    4. Swelling of the Parts : Beſides the Uſe of
    the Electuary, they diſcuſſed it with a Lee of
    Vine Aſhes, or of Birch, Beech, or Oak Aſhes,
    wherein were boiled Origanum, Calamint,
    and Chickweed ; and fomented daily with
    theſe, boiled Herbs in a Bag, and anointed
    after with Oyl of Caſtor or Walnut. --— The
    Diſcharge of Lee from Toes and Fingers, was let
    alone to great Advantage ; but, if needful,
    Furnace or Oven Aſhes, with Cream, were applied.
    --- 6. Feveriſh Heat was moſtly taken off by
    the Purging and Electuary, but if it reſiſted
    them, the Sick had their Meat boiled with
    Lettice, Endive, Cichory, Wood Sorrel, Vine
    Leaves, &c. or gave Powders of them often,
    or applied Leaves of Water Lillies to the Liver
    and Kidneys. --- 7. The Epilepſy : The Parts
    were ſo held as to be moved a little, neither
    violently bended, nor extended, but well
    rubbed and wrapt up with Cloaths ; and Rue,
    Caſtor, Lavender, wild Thyme, or Origanum, held
    to the Noſe, and half a Spoonful of their Juice,
    Wine, or Infuſion, drunk, &c. Its ſurprizing
    they tried not the Uſe of Bathing in tepid
    Water for theſe Convulſions ; for I do avouch,
    upon a 30 Years Experience of its Efficacy, in
    Spaſmodit, Convulſive, Epileptic, Scoibutic,
    Calculous, and ſeveral other Kinds of moſt
    terrible diſtracting Pains, and Contractions. The
    whole Circle of Medicine falls unſpeakably
    ſhort of its Succeſs, and that very often
    inſtantaneous ; but never ſuffer the Water to be
    warmer than new Milk ; the Patient to ſit in
    it uncovered from 10 to 40 Minutes, and
    repeat its Uſe as they can bear it. --- 8. The
    Apoplectic Symptom : When the Sick laid
    quite ſtiff, with ſcarce any viſible Life, they
    let Blood from their Arm, from 12 to 16
    Ounces, in a ſmall Stream, at ſeveral ſhort
    Intervals, laying the Thumb a little each Time
    on the Orifice ; for though this Symptom
    required Bleeding, the Diſeaſe forbid it ; then put
    Ligatures on the Extremes, gave ſome proper
    diſtilled Waters, and laid a Cataplaſm on the
    Feet, injected ſtimulant Clyſters, and uſed
    Friction to all the Extremes ; then bathed the
    Body with Wine, and put Fumigations under
    the Noſe. --- 9. The Lethargy, out of which
    they were ſcarcely to be rouzed : Sharp
    Clyſters were injected, the Noſe rubb’d with the
    above Aromatics, and the Head fomented with
    a Decoction of them in Wine and Vinegar.
    Water and Vinegar, with Sage and
    Juniper-berries bruiſed, were thrown on hot Bricks of
    Flint Stones near the Beds of the Sick ; and
    kindled Oak Sticks were put under their Necks
    to excite Pain. --- 10. In Madneſs, Stupor, or
    Delirium, they gave the purging Electuary two
    Days together, then raiſed a Diaphoreſis with
    the convulſive Powder, and by all Means
    induced Sleep.--11. For the Pain of the convulſed
    Parts, after Purging and Sweating, they were
    bathed with ſoftening Oyls, or Wine, or both
    mixt. --- 12. For a Palſy of the Parts, after
    Purging and Sweating, for the firſt eight or ten
    Days, rub the Parts with Oyl of ſweet
    Almonds, Woman’s Milk, and the Marrow
    of Veal Bones, mixt ; for the next eight or ten
    Days, they anointed with wild Cats Greaſe,
    and a little Caſtor, or its Oyl, with the
    Mucilage of Linſeed, mixt. --— Laſtly, Oyl of Eels,
    Foxes, and Oyl of Lillies, of each equal Parts,
    Earth Worms bruiſed in them and ſtrained,
    then add Wine, and boiled away till the
    Wine was ſpent : If theſe ſucceeded not at
    firſt, they deſiſted a little from uſing them,
    then they did well ; or naturally hot Baths
    relieved. --- 13. For Dulneſs of Hearing, and
    Dimneſs of Sight : After Purging and
    Sweating, Time wore both theſe and the other
    Symptoms off. --— Great Rains, Dearth, and
    Scarcity, this Year in England.

    Pegu, one of the richeſt, and fruitfuleſt
    Countries of the World, yet its Metropolis,
    lately repleniſhied with Millions of Inhabitants,
    was waſted by a terrible Famine from War,
    that ſcarce 7000 Men, Women, and Children,
    were left alive ; and theſe were fed on human
    Fleſh ; Parents ate Children, and Children
    Parents ; the Stronger ate up the Weaker. Clark’s
    Examples. --— Says Cole, in the Foro Julii,
    Wolves leaving off to prey on Beaſts, killed
    many Children and Men. This Summer was
    exceſſive Heat and Drought ; Swarms of Fleas,
    Flies, and Gnats, abounded ; as did great
    Plenty of Armenian Apples. Tertians, with
    Spots, and continual Fevers, invaded ; which
    were readily cured by Bleeding, Purging, or a
    bilious Diarrhea. But the Heat encreaſing
    with the Spring and Summer, more ardent
    Fevers, Spots, Worms, Diarrheas, and Vomitings,
    came on ; but Bleeding cured them.
    Smallpox and Meaſles, became epidemic among
    Children ; though the Symptoms were bad,
    yet they moſtly recovered. In the Beginning
    of Harveſt, the Plague, with a Synochus
    Fever ſet in, with Worms, and an exulcerating
    Diarrhea ; ſuch as had a ſtrong Pulſe at the
    Beginning, Watery Urine, and a great Pain of
    the Head, eſcaped, by the Help of Syrup and
    Water of Sorrel after Bleeding. But Bubos
    appearing, (which are always milder than
    Anthraces) the Skin cut, and Pieces of white
    Hellebore Root put in, in the extreme Parts,
    were very uſeful. Where the Urine was moſtly
    turbid on the third Day, they died the fourth.
    Near the End the Pulſe was obſcure and
    weak. Neither Bezoar, nor the Armenian Stone,
    were of any Service here. A ſore Plague
    raged in London, Lichfield, and Leiceſter, &c.

    Juſtus Lipſius tells of a Drought this Year
    of four Months Continuance. Epiſt. Seluc. 47.
    ---The Air in Switzerland all this Year was
    loaded with Vapours, and Exhalations,
    eſpecially about the Sun-riſing ; theſe putrified.
    On March the 8th, was an Earthquake ;
    another September the 7th. Trees were loaded with Fruit,
    but black and rotten before it was
    ripe. The Winter and Spring were rainy ;
    June and July exceſſive hot. A ſevere
    Dyſentery followed, cured by Emetics, Rhubarb,
    Diuretics, Sudorifks, and Reſtringents.—--At
    Piſaurum the Winter was uncommonly ſnowy
    and rainy ; the Spring and whole Summer
    hot and moiſt, Wind South ; the Inhabitants
    ate plentifully of Fruit and Fiſh, and of Lamb
    and Weather Fleſh. July and Auguſt,
    exceſſive ſultry hot. Double Tertians, and continual
    Fevers ſet in, with a ſlight cold Fit, and
    deceived the Phyſicians at firſt, becauſe of its
    Mildneſs. Many, when ſeized, threw out
    black Spots on their Skin. All complained of
    a great Thirſt, Pain of the Head, Kidneys, and
    Loins ; with Watchings, Delirium, Vomitings
    of green and yellow Bile, Anguiſh, Pain at the
    Mouth of the Stomach, and Loſs of Appetite.
    The Urine was thick like a draught Oxes.
    They died the 7th Day, or recovered the 14th ;
    but the greater Part recovered. The Vulgar
    who uſed a plentifuller freer Diet, came better
    off than the Rich, who lived more regularly
    and ſtrictly. Such as had a Pulſe like healthy
    Perſons, the Urine good, with a Syncope,
    the Extreams cold, but parched up within,
    all died the 6th or 7th Day, with all that were
    blooded or purged. Cole. A great Plague

    The Plague raging in Oſtend, and the Low
    Countries, the Soldiers returning from thence
    into England, brought the Infection with them
    to London, and ſeveral other Parts of the
    Nation. Many Citizens fled into other Countries ;
    in ſome they were treated humanely and
    civilly ; in others they were uſed ſpitefully, and
    cruelly expelled ; many ofthem died in
    Highways, Fields, and Barns, and laid too long
    unburied. The City this Year loſt 38244 of
    its Inhabitants. Stow. --— But when the City
    was clear from Infection, then the whole
    Kingdom was viſited. It was very remarkable
    that it did leaſt Execution where the Londoners
    were humanely uſed ; but terrible was the
    Havock it made where they had been
