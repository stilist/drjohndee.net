    Its fifth was April the 15th ; it broke
    out at Shrewſbury, and reigned in the North
    till the end of September ; it began in London
    July the 9th, 1551, and killed 800 the firſt
    Week in a few Hours. It now ſeized Engliſh
    Foreigners, but no Strangers here ; it carried
    off moſtly ſtrong People between 30 and 50
    Years of Age ; rarely touched Women,
    Children, or old People. If they were ſeized in
    their Sleep, they ſounded away, or died on
    their wakening.

    The ſame malignant ſpotted Fever, which
    firſt appeared in Europe in 1505, prevailed
    now again with its malignant contagious
    Conſtitution, from the ſame Cauſe ; for the laſt
    Winter was wholly rainy and ſoutherly. The
    Spring the ſame, with very great and
    deſtructive Inundations, Darkneſs and Fogs, which
    killed the Buds of Trees, eſpecially the Olives.
    This Fever begun ſo mildly, that the Sick
    ſcarce perceived themſelves ill, or in need of
    a Phyſician before it was too late. Nor were
    Phyſicians themſelves leſs deceived, expecting
    a ſpeedy Criſis, but no ſuch thing. The Heat
    was not ſenſibly great, but the inward great
    Perturbation of the whole Body was manifeſt
    from its general and great Laſſitude, Dullneſs
    of the Senſes, ſupine lying in Bed, and heavy
    Headyneſs of the Sick. After the 4th or 7th
    Day they began to talk wildly ; their Eyes
    were red and fiery. The Urine was firſt
    plentiful and whitiſh, then red and turbid ;
    Pulſe low and ſlow ; Excrements corrupt and
    fetid. On the 4th or 7th Day, little red
    Spots like Flea-bites began to appear on the
    Back, Arms, and Breaſt. Very little or no
    Thirſt ; the Tongue was foul. Some were
    watchful, others very ſleepy, and ſome both
    in their Turns ; ſome continued in this
    Condition to the 7th or 14th Day, or longer.
    Some had a Stoppage of Urine, which was a
    bad Sign. No Jews died of it. Some few
    Women and old People died of it ; but it
    made ſad havock of Children and Youth, and
    thoſe of the richer ſort chiefly. All had a
    ſudden and great Loſs of Strength. A ſmall
    Laxative made a great Diſcharge. No
    Mitigation from a Criſis, great Loſs of Blood at the
    Noſe, difficult Eruption ſuddenly
    diſappearing, a livid Colour of the Spots, or a Stoppage
    of Urine, were all bad Signs ; and the
    contrary were good. Great and fatal was the
    Diſſention, of Phyſicians about the Cure ; ſome
    were for bleeding of all freel y; but others
    ſtrictly obſerving tht all that were Blood
    of died, would let none. Others took the
    middle Way, and ordered Blood-letting
    ſparingly at firſt, of plethoric or ſanguine People
    only ; and ſo about other Evacuations and
    Diet. But the beſt Method was a middling
    Diet, and boiled Water given to drink, or
    Water with a little Vinegar, or with
    Cinnamon, and a little Syrup of Wood Sorrel. They
    kept the Air in the Rooms of the Sick, clear
    and good ; or perfumed by burning Herbs and
    Gums. After the ſecond Day none were let
    Blood, but were cupped, or had the Saphena,
    or Hemorrhoidal Veins opened. Where the
    Body was full of groſs Humours, they gave
    Caſſia, Manna, or Syrup of pale Roſes, or
    with Agaric. About the Eruption, of the
    Puſtules came out ſlowly, they gave Scordium,
    Trifol. Odorat. but no ſtrong Sudorifics. They
    uſed powerful Diuretics. All hot Things
    given, added to the Fever, encreaſed its
    Danger and bad Symptoms.

    Hoofs burnt and waſhed, (in Juice of Sorrel
    and Trefoil) each a Scruple ; Juniper Berries

    inſatiable Thirſt, and killed the 4th Day.
    Carbuncles, and itching black Puſtules came out on

    were uſed ; but Scarification and Cupping of
    the lower Parts, Leeches behind the Ears, and
    to the Hemorrhoidal Veſſels. But above all,

    of the Heart, Fainting, Delirium, Difficulty of
    Breathing, Cough, bloody Urine, Dyſentery,
    involuntary profuſe Tears, ſo as the cryſtaline
    Humour of the Eye was often loſt. Face and
    Body were firſt red, then quickly deformed
    with many Puſtules. The Pox appeared the
    fourth Day. On taking a Cordial, mild
    Diaphoretic, &c. the Fever and other Symptoms
    abated, except the Sick catched Cold, had a
    Looſeneſs, or were ſuffocated. The Diſeaſe
    prevailed as much in Harveſt as in Summer
    only it was milder. Tho. Bartholin. --- 1557,
    This Year and laſt was a great Scarcity of
    Corn from the paſt great Rains. It was a very
    unſeaſonable Year in England, all the Corn was
    choaked and blaſted, the Harveſt exceſſive
    wet and rainy ; before Harveſt this Year,
    Wheat was ſold at 4 Marks per Quarter, Malt
    at 44s. per Quarter, Peaſe at 46s. 8d. After
    Harveſt Wheat was ſold at 5s. per Quarter in
    London, 4s. in the Country. Malt at 6s. 8d.
    and in the Country at 4s. 8d. Rye at 3s. 4d.
    per Quarter in London, and in ſome Places at
    4d. per Buſhel. Clark’s Ex. --- Quartan Agues
    ſtill reigned fatally. In ſome more remote
    Countries, July, Auguſt, and September, were
    exceſſive hot and dry. In the End of September,
    came a very ſtrong cold North Wind ;
    preſently after were many Catarrhs, quickly
    followed by a moſt ſevere Cough, Pain of the
    Side, Difficulty of Breathing, and a Fever.
    The Pain was neither violent nor pricking, but
    mild. The 3d Day they expectorated freely.
    The 6th, 7th, or at the fartheſt the 8th Day ;
    all who had that Pain of the Side died ; but
    ſuch as were blooded the 1ſt or 2d Day,
    recovered on the 4th or 5th ; but bleeding on the
    laſt two Days, did no Service. Slippery,
    thickening, Linctuſes, were found of moſt Service.
    Broths, or Spoon-meats, or moiſt Foods were
    good. --- But where the Seaſon continued ſtill
    rainy, the Caſe was very different ; for at Mantua
    Carpentaria, three Miles from Madrid, the
    Epidemic began in Auguſt, and bleeding or
    purging was ſo dangerous, that in the ſmall
    Town 2000 were let Blood of, and all died.
    There it began with a Roughneſs of the Jaws,
    and ſmall Cough, then a ſtrong Fever, with a Pain
    of the Head, Back, and Legs ; ſome felt as tho’ they
    were corded over the Breaſt, and had a
    Weight at the Stomach ; all which continued
    to the 3d Day at fartheſt ; then the Fever went
    off with a Sweat, or bleeding at the Noſe. In
    ſome few it turned to a Pleuriſy, or fatal
    Peripneumony. --- At Alcmaria, this Year in
    October, raged ſuch an Epidemic, as ſeized whole
    Families at once. In that ſmall Place died in
    three Weeks 200 Perſons of this mortal
    Peripneumony. It attacked like a Catarrh, with a
    very ſlow and malignant Fever, bringing as it
    were a ſudden Suffocation along with it ;
    then ſeized the Breaſt with ſo great a
    Difficulty of Breathing, that the Sick ſeemed dying.
    Preſently it laid hold of the Precordia and
    Stomach, and with a violent Cough, which
    either cauſed Abortion, or killed gravid
    Women. Some, but very few, had continual
    Fevers along with it ; many had double Tertians ;
    other ſimple ſlight Intermittents. All were
    worſe by Night than by Day ; ſuch as
    recovered were long valetudinary, had a weak
    Stomach, and hypped. This Diſeaſe ſeized moſt
    Counties very ſuddenly when it entered,
    catching thouſands the ſame Moment. Thick
    ill ſmelling Fogs preceded it ſome Days. In
    ſome Places few recovered who had it
    accompanied with a violent Fever. Semitertians were
    next dangerous. If Intermittents accompanied
    the Pain of the Throat (which was neither a
    Quinzy, nor ſcarce a ſlight Inflammation, but
    only from a meer Defluxion, of which the Sick
    ſeemed choaked) they were better off, even
    without bleeding. But if the Fever
    ſupervened, and was not well managed, it was often
    fatal. Gentle bleeding the firſt Day was
    uſeful. For the Throat Gargles of Plantin,
    Scabious, and red Roſe Wafers, Quinces,
    Mulberries, and ſealed Earth, were uſed. For the
    Cough and Hoarſeneſs, pectoral and oyly
    Mixtures. Scarification with Cupping,
    ſucceeded better than bleeding. The Year 1555
    had been moſt exceſſively rainy, and 1556, as
    great a Drought --- After a great Scarcity of
    Corn, not from Famine, but the rich
    Cornmongers had bought and hoarded it up, till it
    was ſpoiled, which forced the Poor to eat
    Oxes and Swines Dung, &c. A ſudden and
    terrible Plague broke out between Delph and
    the Hague, in a ſmall Village, and ſpread
    over the whole Country in June, before the
    riſing of the Dog-Star. In Children it was
    attended with Spots. This Plague was
    preſaged by Stars, and Fire falling to the Ground
    on the Streets of Delph. Children in their
    Play digged Graves, and carried dead Coffins
    on their Shoulders ; ſung funeral Hymns like
    their Prieſts, and pretended to bury living
    Children their Playfellows. So great was this
    Mortality, that the Poor fought for Coffins
    for their dead Relations. Abortions, and Death
    of Childbed Women were common. This
    Plague continued till May 1558, and killed
    5000 of the Poor of Delph only. Dodoneus.
    Schinckius. Foreſtus. Platerus. Stow. &c. ---
    A Dearth afflicted England ; Wheat ſold at
    55s. per Qnarter ; but a good and plentiful
    Crop this Harveſt brought it to 4s. or 5s. ----
    September the 7th, ſeven a Clock at Night, in a
    black rainy Cloud in the Weſt was ſeen a
    Rainbow, the Moon in the Eaſt, ſhining bright, and
    at full the Day before. In September exceſſive
    Rains, and a great Death, chiefly of Prieſts.
    Baker’s Chron.--- At Numigen, in July, raged
    an Epidemic, which ſpared none, and ſo cruel
    that it carried off many the 4th, 7th or 14th
    Day. It ſeized with a Fever, Roughneſs, or
    burning Inflammation of the Throat, and the
    Fever continual. The Sick were afflicted with
    a grievous Pain of the Head, taring Cough,
    and conſtant ſevere Pain of the Loins, that
    they couldd not walk ; and ſo large a Diſcharge
    by the Noſe, as would ſcarce ſuffer them to
    breath. Such as eſcaped by Bleeding,
    Pectorals, and a ſtinking Sweat ſupervening, had
    their entire Strength in all Parts continue. But
    ſuch as ſunk under the Fever, and want of
    Eating, becoming weak, all died. Wherefore
    the Cure turned on the Uſe of ſpeedy
    Univerſals, recalling the Appetite, keeping the
    Veſſels of the Throat open. Lenitives only were
    uſed, ſtrong Purges being fatal. --- In Harveſt
    a peſtilential Fever raged in France, and
    carried off many. Dyſenteries, with a ſlight
    Fever prevailed at the ſame Time ; but by the
    early Uſe of Rhubarb, all had their Gripes
    appeaſed, and recovered. Rever. Holer. &c. This
    Year there was a great Flood in the ſouth of
    Languedoc, with ſo dreadful a Tempeſt, that
    People imagined it was the laſt Day. Vignier.
    The rapid Deſcent of the Waters about
    Niſmes, removed divers Heaps and Mountains
    of Ground, and rent and tore up many other
    Places ; by which was diſcovered much Gold and
    Silver Coins, Plate, and other valuable Veſſels,
    ſuppoſed to be hid in the Gothiſh Invaſion.

    Within a Mile of Nottingham was a
    grievous Tempeſt with Thunder, which, as it
    came through two Towns, beat down the
    Churches and all the Houſes, caſt the Bells to
    the Outſide of the Church Yard, and twiſted
    the Sheets of Lead like a Pair of Gloves,
    threw them 400 Foot into the Field. The
    Water and Mud of the Trent between them was
    taken up, carried a quarter of a Mile, and
    thrown in the Trees. Trees were torn up by
    the Roots ; Hailſtones that were 15 Inches
    about, fell down ; a Child was taken out of a
    Womans Arms, and carried up into the Air,
    then let fall, had its Arm broken and died ;
    ſix Men were killed, yet had neither Fleſh nor
    Skin hurt. This Year and laſt, Quartans
    were epidemic and fatal, killed many old
    People, eſpecially Divines ; great Numbers of
    Pariſhes were unſerved. Now another great
    Scarcity of Corn from want of Workers to
    get it ; Corn 14s. per Quarter. This was a
    cold Winter with a North Wind ; a ſoutherly
    rainy Spring ; an exceſſive hot Summer. In
    Harveſt Dyſenteries broke out in France and
    Paris. In Holland Semitertians acted the ſame
    Tragedy on the Rich that the Plague did on
    the Poor laſt Year. —-- All the Spring,
    Summer, and Harveſt, (ſays Jul. Palmer.
    Conſtantin.) being hot and dry, all Europe was
    grievouſly afflicted with ſundry Fevers, eſpecially
    Intermittents, and theſe very long, but not ſo
    mortal. There were alſo other Diſtempers at
    the ſame Time, as Dyſenteries, Stranguries,
    Ophthalmias, conſumptive Diſorders, &c.---In
    September, while Charles the Vth lay on his
    Death-bed, a blazing Star appeared in Spain,
    dim at firſt, but with the Encreaſe of his
    Diſtemper it grew bigger ; at laſt ſhooting its
    fiery Hair directly againſt the Monaſtery where
    he lay. The very Hour the Emperor died,
    it evaniſhed. Strada.
