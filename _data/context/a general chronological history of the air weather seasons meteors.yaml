    Its fifth was April the 15th ; it broke
    out at Shrewſbury, and reigned in the North
    till the end of September ; it began in London
    July the 9th, 1551, and killed 800 the firſt
    Week in a few Hours. It now ſeized Engliſh
    Foreigners, but no Strangers here ; it carried
    off moſtly ſtrong People between 30 and 50
    Years of Age ; rarely touched Women,
    Children, or old People. If they were ſeized in
    their Sleep, they ſounded away, or died on
    their wakening.

    The ſame malignant ſpotted Fever, which
    firſt appeared in Europe in 1505, prevailed
    now again with its malignant contagious
    Conſtitution, from the ſame Cauſe ; for the laſt
    Winter was wholly rainy and ſoutherly. The
    Spring the ſame, with very great and
    deſtructive Inundations, Darkneſs and Fogs, which
    killed the Buds of Trees, eſpecially the Olives.
    This Fever begun ſo mildly, that the Sick
    ſcarce perceived themſelves ill, or in need of
    a Phyſician before it was too late. Nor were
    Phyſicians themſelves leſs deceived, expecting
    a ſpeedy Criſis, but no ſuch thing. The Heat
    was not ſenſibly great, but the inward great
    Perturbation of the whole Body was manifeſt
    from its general and great Laſſitude, Dullneſs
    of the Senſes, ſupine lying in Bed, and heavy
    Headyneſs of the Sick. After the 4th or 7th
    Day they began to talk wildly ; their Eyes
    were red and fiery. The Urine was firſt
    plentiful and whitiſh, then red and turbid ;
    Pulſe low and ſlow ; Excrements corrupt and
    fetid. On the 4th or 7th Day, little red
    Spots like Flea-bites began to appear on the
    Back, Arms, and Breaſt. Very little or no
    Thirſt ; the Tongue was foul. Some were
    watchful, others very ſleepy, and ſome both
    in their Turns ; ſome continued in this
    Condition to the 7th or 14th Day, or longer.
    Some had a Stoppage of Urine, which was a
    bad Sign. No Jews died of it. Some few
    Women and old People died of it ; but it
    made ſad havock of Children and Youth, and
    thoſe of the richer ſort chiefly. All had a
    ſudden and great Loſs of Strength. A ſmall
    Laxative made a great Diſcharge. No
    Mitigation from a Criſis, great Loſs of Blood at the
    Noſe, difficult Eruption ſuddenly
    diſappearing, a livid Colour of the Spots, or a Stoppage
    of Urine, were all bad Signs ; and the
    contrary were good. Great and fatal was the
    Diſſention, of Phyſicians about the Cure ; ſome
    were for bleeding of all freel y; but others
    ſtrictly obſerving tht all that were Blood
    of died, would let none. Others took the
    middle Way, and ordered Blood-letting
    ſparingly at firſt, of plethoric or ſanguine People
    only ; and ſo about other Evacuations and
    Diet. But the beſt Method was a middling
    Diet, and boiled Water given to drink, or
    Water with a little Vinegar, or with
    Cinnamon, and a little Syrup of Wood Sorrel. They
    kept the Air in the Rooms of the Sick, clear
    and good ; or perfumed by burning Herbs and
    Gums. After the ſecond Day none were let
    Blood, but were cupped, or had the Saphena,
    or Hemorrhoidal Veins opened. Where the
    Body was full of groſs Humours, they gave
    Caſſia, Manna, or Syrup of pale Roſes, or
    with Agaric. About the Eruption, of the
    Puſtules came out ſlowly, they gave Scordium,
    Trifol. Odorat. but no ſtrong Sudorifics. They
    uſed powerful Diuretics. All hot Things
    given, added to the Fever, encreaſed its
    Danger and bad Symptoms.

    Hoofs burnt and waſhed, (in Juice of Sorrel
    and Trefoil) each a Scruple ; Juniper Berries

    inſatiable Thirſt, and killed the 4th Day.
    Carbuncles, and itching black Puſtules came out on

    were uſed ; but Scarification and Cupping of
    the lower Parts, Leeches behind the Ears, and
    to the Hemorrhoidal Veſſels. But above all,

    of the Heart, Fainting, Delirium, Difficulty of
    Breathing, Cough, bloody Urine, Dyſentery,
    involuntary profuſe Tears, ſo as the cryſtaline
    Humour of the Eye was often loſt. Face and
    Body were firſt red, then quickly deformed
    with many Puſtules. The Pox appeared the
    fourth Day. On taking a Cordial, mild
    Diaphoretic, &c. the Fever and other Symptoms
    abated, except the Sick catched Cold, had a
    Looſeneſs, or were ſuffocated. The Diſeaſe
    prevailed as much in Harveſt as in Summer
    only it was milder. Tho. Bartholin. --- 1557,
    This Year and laſt was a great Scarcity of
    Corn from the paſt great Rains. It was a very
    unſeaſonable Year in England, all the Corn was
    choaked and blaſted, the Harveſt exceſſive
    wet and rainy ; before Harveſt this Year,
    Wheat was ſold at 4 Marks per Quarter, Malt
    at 44s. per Quarter, Peaſe at 46s. 8d. After
    Harveſt Wheat was ſold at 5s. per Quarter in
    London, 4s. in the Country. Malt at 6s. 8d.
    and in the Country at 4s. 8d. Rye at 3s. 4d.
    per Quarter in London, and in ſome Places at
    4d. per Buſhel. Clark’s Ex. --- Quartan Agues
    ſtill reigned fatally. In ſome more remote
    Countries, July, Auguſt, and September, were
    exceſſive hot and dry. In the End of September,
    came a very ſtrong cold North Wind ;
    preſently after were many Catarrhs, quickly
    followed by a moſt ſevere Cough, Pain of the
    Side, Difficulty of Breathing, and a Fever.
    The Pain was neither violent nor pricking, but
    mild. The 3d Day they expectorated freely.
    The 6th, 7th, or at the fartheſt the 8th Day ;
    all who had that Pain of the Side died ; but
    ſuch as were blooded the 1ſt or 2d Day,
    recovered on the 4th or 5th ; but bleeding on the
    laſt two Days, did no Service. Slippery,
    thickening, Linctuſes, were found of moſt Service.
    Broths, or Spoon-meats, or moiſt Foods were
    good. --- But where the Seaſon continued ſtill
    rainy, the Caſe was very different ; for at Mantua
    Carpentaria, three Miles from Madrid, the
    Epidemic began in Auguſt, and bleeding or
    purging was ſo dangerous, that in the ſmall
    Town 2000 were let Blood of, and all died.
    There it began with a Roughneſs of the Jaws,
    and ſmall Cough, then a ſtrong Fever, with a Pain
    of the Head, Back, and Legs ; ſome felt as tho’ they
    were corded over the Breaſt, and had a
    Weight at the Stomach ; all which continued
    to the 3d Day at fartheſt ; then the Fever went
    off with a Sweat, or bleeding at the Noſe. In
    ſome few it turned to a Pleuriſy, or fatal
    Peripneumony. --- At Alcmaria, this Year in
    October, raged ſuch an Epidemic, as ſeized whole
    Families at once. In that ſmall Place died in
    three Weeks 200 Perſons of this mortal
    Peripneumony. It attacked like a Catarrh, with a
    very ſlow and malignant Fever, bringing as it
    were a ſudden Suffocation along with it ;
    then ſeized the Breaſt with ſo great a
    Difficulty of Breathing, that the Sick ſeemed dying.
    Preſently it laid hold of the Precordia and
    Stomach, and with a violent Cough, which
    either cauſed Abortion, or killed gravid
    Women. Some, but very few, had continual
    Fevers along with it ; many had double Tertians ;
    other ſimple ſlight Intermittents. All were
    worſe by Night than by Day ; ſuch as
    recovered were long valetudinary, had a weak
    Stomach, and hypped. This Diſeaſe ſeized moſt
    Counties very ſuddenly when it entered,
    catching thouſands the ſame Moment. Thick
    ill ſmelling Fogs preceded it ſome Days. In
    ſome Places few recovered who had it
    accompanied with a violent Fever. Semitertians were
    next dangerous. If Intermittents accompanied
    the Pain of the Throat (which was neither a
    Quinzy, nor ſcarce a ſlight Inflammation, but
    only from a meer Defluxion, of which the Sick
    ſeemed choaked) they were better off, even
    without bleeding. But if the Fever
    ſupervened, and was not well managed, it was often
    fatal. Gentle bleeding the firſt Day was
    uſeful. For the Throat Gargles of Plantin,
    Scabious, and red Roſe Wafers, Quinces,
    Mulberries, and ſealed Earth, were uſed. For the
    Cough and Hoarſeneſs, pectoral and oyly
    Mixtures. Scarification with Cupping,
    ſucceeded better than bleeding. The Year 1555
    had been moſt exceſſively rainy, and 1556, as
    great a Drought --- After a great Scarcity of
    Corn, not from Famine, but the rich
    Cornmongers had bought and hoarded it up, till it
    was ſpoiled, which forced the Poor to eat
    Oxes and Swines Dung, &c. A ſudden and
    terrible Plague broke out between Delph and
    the Hague, in a ſmall Village, and ſpread
    over the whole Country in June, before the
    riſing of the Dog-Star. In Children it was
    attended with Spots. This Plague was
    preſaged by Stars, and Fire falling to the Ground
    on the Streets of Delph. Children in their
    Play digged Graves, and carried dead Coffins
    on their Shoulders ; ſung funeral Hymns like
    their Prieſts, and pretended to bury living
    Children their Playfellows. So great was this
    Mortality, that the Poor fought for Coffins
    for their dead Relations. Abortions, and Death
    of Childbed Women were common. This
    Plague continued till May 1558, and killed
    5000 of the Poor of Delph only. Dodoneus.

    A Dearth afflicted England ; Wheat ſold at
    55s. per Qnarter ; but a good and plentiful
    Crop this Harveſt brought it to 4s. or 5s. ----
    September the 7th, ſeven a Clock at Night, in a
    black rainy Cloud in the Weſt was ſeen a
    Rainbow, the Moon in the Eaſt, ſhining bright, and
    at full the Day before. In September exceſſive
    Rains, and a great Death, chiefly of Prieſts.
    Baker’s Chron.--- At Numigen, in July, raged
    an Epidemic, which ſpared none, and ſo cruel
    that it carried off many the 4th, 7th or 14th
    Day. It ſeized with a Fever, Roughneſs, or
    burning Inflammation of the Throat, and the
    Fever continual. The Sick were afflicted with
    a grievous Pain of the Head, taring Cough,
    and conſtant ſevere Pain of the Loins, that
    they couldd not walk ; and ſo large a Diſcharge
    by the Noſe, as would ſcarce ſuffer them to
    breath. Such as eſcaped by Bleeding,
    Pectorals, and a ſtinking Sweat ſupervening, had
    their entire Strength in all Parts continue. But
    ſuch as ſunk under the Fever, and want of
    Eating, becoming weak, all died. Wherefore
    the Cure turned on the Uſe of ſpeedy
    Univerſals, recalling the Appetite, keeping the
    Veſſels of the Throat open. Lenitives only were
    uſed, ſtrong Purges being fatal. --- In Harveſt
    a peſtilential Fever raged in France, and
    carried off many. Dyſenteries, with a ſlight
    Fever prevailed at the ſame Time ; but by the
    early Uſe of Rhubarb, all had their Gripes
    appeaſed, and recovered. Rever. Holer. &c. This
    Year there was a great Flood in the ſouth of
    Languedoc, with ſo dreadful a Tempeſt, that
    People imagined it was the laſt Day. Vignier.
    The rapid Deſcent of the Waters about
    Niſmes, removed divers Heaps and Mountains
    of Ground, and rent and tore up many other
    Places ; by which was diſcovered much Gold and
    Silver Coins, Plate, and other valuable Veſſels,
    ſuppoſed to be hid in the Gothiſh Invaſion.

    Within a Mile of Nottingham was a
    grievous Tempeſt with Thunder, which, as it
    came through two Towns, beat down the
    Churches and all the Houſes, caſt the Bells to
    the Outſide of the Church Yard, and twiſted

    threw them 400 Foot into the Field. The
    Water and Mud of the Trent between them was
    taken up, carried a quarter of a Mile, and

    This Year raged at
    Numigen the Cholera Morbus, and killed many
    within four Days ; but moſt of them who
    ſought Help at firſt recovered. When they
    had vomited enough they took Marmalade of
    Quince with Aromatics, if the Fever run not
    high ; but where it did, they left out the laſt,
    and gave the firſt Morning and Night, and
    half an Hour before Meat for three Days, and
    forbid the Sick all Drink except a very little,
    though their Thirſt was great ; for drinking
    encreaſed the Evacuations, and theſe brought
    Death. To the ſtrongly convulſed Parts they
    uſed a warm Fomentation of Oyl of
    Cammomil, and to the Stomach and Belly,
    EmbrocationS of Oyl of Nard, Maſtick, and
    Quinces ; then ſtrowed over all, Powders of
    Aſtringents and Aromatics ; then gave Opiates,
    with Abſorbents, and Reſtringents ; but firſt
    of all they gave Rhubarb, and to Children
    Clyſters. Reverius. --- Some Years
    preceeding this, on the lower Rhine, had been
    exceſsive wet and rainy, and cauſed moſt ſhocking
    Deſolation by a great Mortality. The Winter
    before, had very often been ſeen at Night,
    ſundry arid terrible Lights and fiery Meteors
    in the Air, ſometimes ſtanding ſtill,
    othertimes darting forth their Streamers ſuddenly :
    They continued all Summer, and the
    Beginning of next Winter, &c. Beſides frequent
    Abortions, fearful Torments from Worms,
    often arthritic Pains, and depraved Motions of
    the Joints, appeared the Meaſles and
    Smallpox, as the Forerunners of a very fatal
    Epidemic ; which, with incredible Cruelty, in a
    manner depopulated Cities, Towns, and
    Countries ; witneſs Conſtantinople, Alexandria,
    Lyons, Dantzick, London, Auſburgh, Vienna,
    Cologn, and all the upper Rhine even to Baſil,
    but milder on the lower Rhine ; all riſen from
    the great and univerſal Rains and Moiſture,
    cauſing acute and chronic Defluxions. In the
    Winter of 1564, came outward glandular
    Swellings of the Neck, but void of Danger.
    In the Spring began and laſted moſt of the
    Summer, frequent dangerous Quinſies, of
    ſudden Termination ; which for its Rage,
    Danger, and ſhort Continuance, was little ſhort of
    a Plague, continuing but one, two, three, or
    four Days ; if the Sick outlived the ſeventh or
    eighth, they recovered. They began moſtly
    at the new Moon, with a Fever and
    Vomiting, from the ſmalleſt encreaſed bodily
    Exerciſe, as walking in the Heat of the Sun, or
    from too great Heat of the Fire ; then came
    inſtantly a Swelling of the Tongue, with Loſs
    of Speech ; the Gullet itſelf was cloſely ſhut
    up, that Drink could not paſs : Theſe
    Symptoms killed the Sick, than which no Death
    could be more cruel. There was no viſible
    Swelling on the Neck, only in ſome an
    Appearance of an Eriſepylas. But the Defluxion of
    the virulent Humour fell inwards, which often
    produced a Frenzy, frequently leaving the Jaws
    it fell on the Side ; hence a Pleuriſy, every jot
    as fatal as the Quinſey. Sometimes it was
    tranſferred to the Lungs, and terminated in a
    Peripneumony. Other times leaving the whole
    Thorax, it ſhifted to the Spine of the Back,
    and cauſed intolerable Pains, eſpecially in
    menſtruous Women ; but it was equally
    mortal in all Shapes and Forms. This Quinſey
    was leſs dangerous to Youth than grown up
    People, and they recovered ſooner, eſpecially
    if the laſt did not keep their Bed. In this
    peſtilential Epidemic (which in many Places
    was a true Plague, and at other Places, as at
    Crete, Raguſa, Venice, &c. it was a ſpotted
    Fever) bleeding and purging did much more
    Miſchief than Good ; only bleeding Youth
    under the Tongue, and dry cupping to the
    Neck and Shoulders, gently repellent and
    ſtrengthning Medicines, and Alexipharmics
    topically uſed with great Diſcretion, were
    beneficial. When Winter came, there were
    above two Months of the greateſt Froſt, and
    ſevereſt Cold felt by any living ; and near the
    End very much Snow, which put an End to
    the laſt fatal, malignant, contagious Epidemic.
    The Cold remitted for ſix or ſeven Days
    without a Thaw, then was the Air filled with
    Fog and Vapours, which being neither
    diſsolved nor diſcuſsed, but rather condenſed
    by the Night’s Cold, rendred the Air thick
    and moiſt ; hence ſprung another new, real,
    and no leſs inflammatory Diſeaſe : The Sick
    were firſt ſeized with a continual Fever of a
    bad Kind, they felt an obtuſe and pricking
    Pain in their Side, then were they
    tormented with a Shortneſs of Breath ; then
    the fixt Pain of the Side which game at firſt,
    ſhifted, and ſlowly moved over the whole
    Breaſt, eſpecially if any Anodyne was given ;
    next, with a ſudden Jerk it moves again, and
    falls on the Lungs, which being over-loaded
    and over-flooded by a ſudden impetuous Flux
    of Humours, the ſpitting became bloody, and
    mixt with divers Colours, which the more
    plentiful it was, and eaſily expectorated, ſo
    much greater Danger, ſuch generally dying
    the ſixth Day. Some had no ſpitting of Blood ;
    if ſuch got over the ninth Day, they
    generally recovered, except they relapſed, then they
    died before the three Weeks End. Such as
    had a Looſeneſs, or Delirium, died. All had
    a Cough and Hoarſneſs. The Cure, conſiſted
    in immediate and large Bleeding, and freely
    uſing Subacids ; as Syrup of Wood Sorrel,
    Sorrel in Carduus or Scabious Waters : Then
    gave Decoctions of Pectorals and Bitters mixt,
    as Scordium, Baum, Carduus Beuedictus,
    Scabious, Sorrel, &c. and added Sugar with a
    little Vinegar. Purging was hurtful, but if
    indicated, they gave laxative Clyſters, or
    Rhubarb infuſed, with ſolutive Syrup of Roſes.
    Nor were the peſtilential Pills wholly uſeleſs,
    being both alexipharmic and diaphoretic.
    Such as went out of Doors an Hour or two
    after Sunſet, were ſooneſt and moſt
    dangerouſly taken. Such as went abroad in the
    middle of the Day, during theſe ſeven Days
    Fog, were in leſs Danger. Fires of Oakwood
    in Rooms were very ſerviceable, and the beſt.

    This Spring having great, and almoſt
    continual Rains, with moſt frightful Floods,
    the Summer and Harveſt were droughty, clear,
    not one Drop of Rain the whole Harveſt.
    At Commora in Hungary, broke out the
    Hungarian Fever, in the Emperor Maximilian’s
    Army, juſt before he broke up that Campaign
    againſt the Turks. The exceſsive Spring Rains
    had made them two Months later in taking
    the Field. It encreaſed at Gewer ; and when
    his Soldiers were diſbanded, they carried the
    Contagion along with them, and diſperſed it
    all over Europe, eſpecially over Germany,
    Burgundy, Italy, Bohemia, and Flanders ; but
    chiefly in Vienna, through which moſt of them
    paſt in their Return home. They infected all
    Houſes there where they laid, and died ſo faſt
    themſelves, that the Streets, were covered
    with dead Bodies : This encreaſed the
    Infection. The Fever began at 3 or 4 a Clock in
    the Afternoon, with ſlight Cold and ſhivering
    for a quarter of an Hour ; this was followed
    ever after by an intenſe violent Heat, with an
    intolerable Pain of the Head, Hardneſs and
    Renitency, and Pain of the Mouth of the
    Stomach, ſo that the ſlighteſt Touch of ones
    Finger, or the Bed-cloaths, made the Sick
    throw out moſt piercing Screighs : (Theſe two
    laſt Pains being the characteriſtick and
    pathognominic Signs of this Fever.) Unquenchable
    Thirſt for the firſt two or three Days,
    eſpecially for Wine, which yet was certainly fatal to
    all that drunk it ; the Tongue was dry, the
    Lips chopt. The third Day they were
    delirious, yet then all talked of their own Trade
    or Buſineſs ; the Delirium continued ſeveral
    Days ; they grew worſe in the Evening, and
    the Fever was higheſt in the Night. Some
    ſpit Blood or had Pains in the Sides, or
    colical Pains in the Belly. A critical Looſeneſs, or
    Deafneſs were good Signs. Swellings behind
    the Ears were frequent. But the moſt
    miſerable Criſis was, Tubercles on the Top of the
    Foot, which, if neglected, or ill treated, often
    ended in a Mortification ; many had their
    Feet cut off. Such as outlived the 14th or
    20th Day, recovered. All had Spots like
    Flea-bitings, ſome ſmaller, ſome larger, on
    their Breaſt, Back-bone, or Over their whole
    Body ; ſome had them on their Shoulders and
    Arms ; if livid or black, they were fatal. Large
    bleeding, at firſt Seizure, of all Things was
    moſt uſeful. Some gave the white of an Egg
    beaten to a Froth, with a Dram ; or half a
    Dram of Saffron poudered, in two Ounces of
    ſtrong Spirits ; and cleanſed their Mouth with
    a Cloth dipt in the ſame Mixture : This they
    gave at Night, and ſome repeated it next
    Morning ; but none had it a third Time, for
    they every one died before Night. Some gave
    the expreſsied Juice of 20 Leaves of Houſleek
    either with a Scruple of Sal Armoniac, or a
    little Camphire in Spring Water ; this
    ſucceeded better. But the moſt ſucceſsful and
    rational Method was, after bleeding and a
    Laxative, and ordering acid Drink, and a Diet,
    to give briſk Diaphoretics, as Mithridate,
    Treacle ; thus, Take Treacle of Alexandria,
    choice Mithridate, of each three Ounces ; the
    beſt Zedoary, one Ounce ; white Ginger, half
    an Ounce ; Roots of Tormentil, Pimpernel,
    Snake Root, of each three Drams ; Camphire,
    two Drams ; Myrrh, Saffron, Bone of a Stag’s
    Heart, Dittany, of each two Scruples ; mix for
    Uſe : Give in Spring Water and Vinegar.
    Or in the following, Take Dittany, Madder
    Roots, Avens, wild Rue, Scabious, Peony,
    Hyſsop, beſt Treacle, of each half an Ounce ;
    Gentian Root, Armenian Bole, Caſtor, St. John’s
    Wort, Tormentil Roots, of each a Dram ;
    infuſe the Powders two Days in Brandy, then
    the Treacle being mixt, keep the filtred
    Liquor for Uſe. Some truſted to Zedoary only,
    given in cordial Waters. Such as were
    ignorant of, or neglected the Influence of the Air,
    laid the whole Cauſe of this Diſeaſe on eating
    too much freſh Meat new killed ; or on the
    groſs Hungarian Air ; or on the ſtrong Wines
    of that Country ; or on the too great Plenty
    of Fiſh, filthy Drink, the Naſtineſs of the
    Camp, &c. But the Hungarians themſelves
    had ſtill better Succeſs with their own Method
    of Cure, for very few of them died in this
    Fever ; they took freſh clean waſhed Lovage Roots,
    pounded them in new Hogs Lard purged from
    its Skins, made a Cataplaſm, and ſpread it all
    over the ſhaven Head cold, eſpecially the
    Forehead and Temples ; then they took a
    Sheet and dipt it in hot Water, or in warm
    Wine and Water, and wrapt it about their
    whole Body, then lay down and ſweat
    profuſely ; and put a Pultis of Garlick, ſteept in
    Vinegar, and beaten up with Bayſalt, to the
    Wriſts and Soles of the Feet. Jordan de

    the Prodigies ſeen in Italy the Year before
    Hannibal came thither with his Army ; for beſides
    extroardinary Thundrings and Lightnings,
    many Targets grew all bloody of themſelves :
    And about Antium, they found Wheat Ears
    which were all bloody when they were
    reaped. There fell from Heaven burning Stones
    all in a Flame of Fire. And in the
    Phalerians Country, the Sky ſeemed to open in

    raged the following fatal Fever (ſays
    Palmarius.) In moſt it began with a violent Pain
    of the Head, which vaniſhed the fourth or
    ſeventh Day, either with great bleeding at the
    Noſe, a Looſneſs, or no viſible or ſenſible
    Evacuation. At firſt was a Defluction from the
    Head on the Parts below, but without any
    Swelling, Watching, continual Toſsings, the
    Urine either thick and black, livid, or reddiſh
    livid, with breaking and a Cloud ; in others
    it was the ſame as in Health ; in ſome few it
    was very muddy ; moſt had neither great Heat
    nor Thirſt ; nor was the Pulſe different from
    what it was in Health : Then about the fourth
    or ſeventh Day, if the Urine had been thick,
    turbid or muddy, it became clearer, evident
    Concoction appeared, the Sick were free from
    Pain or Grief, imagined and aſsured themſelves
    that they were far enough out of all Danger ;
    but their Strength being gone, they quickly
    died, without either Pain or Signs of
    Putridneſs. Some were Phrentic the fourth or
    ſeventh Day, the Diſeaſe falling on the Brain,
    and ſo died ; the Urine moſtly being clear,
    with a laudible Sediment, and other
    conſpicuous Signs of Concoction in the Excrements.
    The Diſeaſe begun in ſome with a Lientaria,
    and indeed a ſpontaneous Diſcharge of crude
    Excrements was ſerviceable to many whoſe
    Strength was kept up by cordial Medicines
    and Food. Many who had taken Aſtringents
    to ſtop the Looſneſs, fell into a Phrenzy and
    died. Many whoſe Looſneſs was encouraged
    by briſk Purges uſed, had their Strength
    leſsened, and died preſently. Others who had
    neither Pain of the Head, Heat, Thirſt,
    Loathing, nor thick muddy Urine, yet were
    confined to Bed of meer Weakneſs ; ſome of theſe,
    their Strength being worn out, died without
    the leaſt Sign of Putrefaction, either in their
    Urine, or Blood let. Others, after the 20th or
    27th Day, got better and recovered. The
    following Signs were common to all, Loathing,
    Pain at the Heart, Failure of Strength, and
    Weakneſs beyond the apparent Symptoms, as
    ſmall languid Pulſe, but quicker and thicker
    than in Health and Reſt, unequal and
    irregular in all ; Nature being proſtrated in many,
    the Pulſe was intercepted, and intermittent :
    The Bodies of moſt were ſpotted all over. Such
    as began the Core with Bleeding and Purging,
    only oppreſsed Nature, quickly ſunk the
    Strength of the Siok, and they all ſuccumbed
    and died. Cordial Medicines and Food alone
    preſerved and reſtored the Sick. The City
    was beſieged all the Harveſt before by a very
    numerous and great Army, whoſe Excrements
    and Naſtineſs had vitiated the Air, ſo as the
    next Spring the above malignant and
    peſtilential Fever began, and raged all the next
    Summer and Harveſt. Though the above were
    the pathognomonic Symptoms, yet it wanted
    not a great many others, according to different
    Conſtitutions, ſundry Ways of Life, and
    Treatment of the Diſeaſe. Its incredible to
    imagine the Havock Stibium given by
    Quacks made among the People of Lyons in their
    deſolating Plague of 1566. At Rome this Year
    were ſuch Floods of the Tyber, that they
    carried off and waſhed away, even to the
    Foundation, a great Part of the City, leaving
    very little behind, beſides the ineſtimable Loſs
    of the City, and its great Riches, and of
    innumerable Cattle, and 1500 People drowned
    in it. Bucholtz. --- In 1567 was a moſt ſevere
    Winter in England ; great Scarcity of Hay, it
    was ſold at 5d. a Stone in the Peak and
    Yorkſhire. The following Summer was an
    exceſsive Drought, and great Death of Cattle.
    March the 18th after, a moſt diſmal and
    deſtructive Hurricane in England and Holland.
    This Year the Plague was in London.---
    November the 1ſt, the Sea ſwelled exceſsively,
    overflowed ſome Banks, and broke down
    others, by a prodigious and Unheard of
    Deluge ; it covered ſome Iſlands of Zealand, a
    great Part of the Sea Coaſt of Holland, and
    almoſt all Frieſland ; it was a Foot higher than
    the like Deluge of 1528, which ſwallowed up
    Villages. Here was an incomparable Loſs of
    Eſtates, but eſpecially of Men. In Frieſland
    alone was drowned 2600 People, whoſe Bodies,
    with the Carcaſes of Cattle, Houſhold Goods,
    &c. floated all oyer the Fields, Land and Sea
    being indiſtinguiſhable. People that had
    climbed to the Tops of high Hills and Trees, when
    juſt ſtarving were ſaved by Boats, &c. Strada.--
    The Air this Year in Italy, (ſays Cole) was
    exceſsive hot and moiſt with a South Wind.
    The contagious Conſtitution of putrid Fevers,
    with Spots of ſeveral Colours, began at
    Bellona, and overſpread all Europe. It began in
    1569, was at its full State in 70, and
    declined in 71. The Symptoms were ſudden
    Loſs of Strength, Thirſt, Watchings,
    Swellings behind the Ears, and in the Arm-pits,
    Heat of the Extremes, Looſeneſs, Want of
    Appetite, voiding of Worms, Coma,
    Reſtleſneſs, Heat of the Bowels ; all eſsayed to riſe
    out of Bed, and threw themſelves out of
    Windows, or into Rivers. Some or more of
    thoſe Symptoms always accompanied the
    Fever, which was acuteſt the 7th or 11th Day ;
    if it turned milder the 7th, all was well ; if
    not, the Danger was great. And after their
    Recovery from the great Shock of the Nerves,
    they continued long ſilly, childiſh, or fooliſh,
    and bald from their Hair felling off. Fat
    and corpulent People ſuffered more, and were
    in more Danger than the thin and lean.
    Bleeding was highly pernicious, cupping and
    ſcarifying as profitable. This in ſeveral Places
    turned to the Plague, and where the Plague
    raged it turned to this Fever, as in Spain,
    Auguſtin, Abios, who dairy viſited Hundreds. In
    this, having conſidered the Nature, Symptoms,
    Manner of the Place, Conſtitution of the Air,
    and Situation, and other Circumſtances of the
    Sick, he omitted bleeding, which at that
    Time he found highly injurious, even to
    plethoric, ſanguine and robuſt People in the
    Flower of Life ; and in room thereof ordered
    Cupping and Scarification on the Back and
    lower Extremes ; then gave a Lenitive of Caſsia
    and Tamarinds, or a cooling laxative Clyſter,
    or ordered cooling attenuating Decoctions or
    Syrups of Wood Sorrel, Endive, Bugloſs,
    Borrage, Violets, Roſes, Cinquefoil, Agrimony,
    Barley, Graſs Roots, and Maiden-hair, with
    Boluſses of Scordium, Sugar of Roſes, and
    Armenian Bole. --- In Spain, this Year, raged
    contagious ſpotted Fevers, which killed almoſt
    all they ſeized ; they were either ardent or
    continent, with a quick, ſmall, weak,
    formicant Pulſe, ſometimes varying or intermitting,
    eſpecially near the appearing of the Spots ;
    the Breath cold, fetid, and difficult ; a
    Trembling and Straitneſs at the Heart ; great
    Reſtleſneſs from the intenſe Heat, Oppreſsion
    of the Breaſt, Pain of the Mouth ; Heavineſs
    of the whole Body, Laſsitude, Inability to
    watch, Delirium followed by Forgetfulneſs,
    and ſometimes Inſolence, great Thirſt,
    Loathing, intolerable Fetor of Things diſcharged.
    The Urine ſometimes thin, other times thick,
    like a Draught-Ox’s arid turbid Sediment.
    Vomits, Tremor of the Tongue, blak Urine,
    were ſure Signs of Recovery. --- October the
    5th, in 1570, ſays Stow, was a great
    Hurricane by Night (as there had been a moſt
    deſtructive one in March 1558) near Rye the
    Sea broke in with a great Flood, drowned a
    great Marſh with Herds of Sheep, Corn, &c.
    In Eſsex, Suffolk, and Norfolk, were great
    Loſses ; one by a Tempeſt, wherein Sheep, Corn,
    Cattle, Houſes, Bridges, &c. were loſt and
    carried down. In 1571, was a great
    Earthquake in Herefordſhire. In theſe Years, ſays
    he, was a great Plague over all Europe. But

    Was extreamly intemperate, with South Wind,
    Rain and Fogs. The Winter following was
    much moiſter, with either continual Rains,
    Wind, or Snow, to the Middle of February ;
    then came an intenſe Cold with a Continual
    North Wind, and thick dark Air to the
    Equinox. The following Spring, Summer, and
    even into Harveſt, were very moiſt and
    watery, with a Sonth Wind, and abundance
    of fiery Meteors ; then followed the Winter,
    which in exceſsive Rains, and South Wind, ſo
    far exceeded all that had gone before ſince
    the Beginning of this Conſtitution in 1568,
    that it was not to be compared with them ;
    and thus it continued daily worſe and worſe
    to the Beginning of January 1574. During all
    this Time reigned a great Scarcity and Dearth
    of Salt, ſo that all Fiſh and Fleſh were eaten
    unſeaſoned. Ruſticks eat up all unwholſome
    watery Garden Product, becauſe of the great
    Famine and Dearth of Corn ; hence aroſe and
    triumphed for two Years, Galen’s
    Hemitritean, or Semitertian Fever ; they broke out in
    Auguſt 1574, but were not epidemic before
    October. In the Summer of 1573 reigned the
    Bloody Flux, Meafles and Worms ; theſe were
    of ſhort Duration till they made Way for a
    malignant Fever, Epilepſy, and Diarrhea, fatal
    to groſs Habits, old People, and intemperate.
    The Contagion and Height of the laſt was
    from the Spring of 1573 to the Spring of 74.
    The Fever began with a moſt terrible Pain of
    the Head, great Pain of the Precordia, a
    ſleepineſs, Thirſt, thick and ſhort Breathing,
    Inflation, ſighing, toſsing, laſsitude, vomiting,
    bilious or pituitous Stools, Defluxions on the
    Noſe, Stomach, Arms or Legs, intolerable Pain
    of the Back, moſtly irregular cold Sweats,
    ending in a fatal Coldneſs ; often Spots in
    ſundry Parts, in ſome with livid Tumours, in
    others with Bladders, and in ſome with
    Excoriations. Some were Lethargic, others quite
    reſtleſs ; the fourth or ſeventh Day they fell
    into a great Phlogoſis with a Delirium ; ſuch
    as purged ſeverely died before the Criſis.
    Deafneſs portended the ſpeedy Termination of the
    Diſeaſe by Sweat or Urine ; whom the Sweat
    reſtored not, laboured long under a Hectic,
    or fell into a Cachexy. They that had great
    Toffings died moſtly on the even Day, and
    alſo ſuch as purged good Blood before the
    ſeventh Day, or had cold Sweats between the
    fourth and ſeventh Day, or had black Spots
    appear. They were followed by a Delirium,
    Tremors, convulſive Pulſe, Toffings, Anxiety,
    involuntary Diſcharge of Urine and Feces. The
    Urine at firſt thin and pale, then reddiſh and
    yellowiſh with Hairs in it, then bloody or
    black. The Cure conſiſted in the early Uſe of
    Rhubarb, attenuating Apozems, Diaphoretics,
    and mild Sudorifics, Scarification and
    Cupping ; Bleeding was fatal afer the firſt Seizure,
    eſpecially after the firſt Day ; ſtrong Purges
    were pernicious. In 1574 came the Plague.

    November the 18th, appeared a Comet for
    16 Months, a new Star very bright and clear,
    larger than Jupiter, far higher than the Place
    of Comets ; it was in the Conſtellation of
    Caſsiopeia, behind her Chair, which, with the
    three fixt Stars there, made a Rhombus
    Figure ; it never changed its Place, but by
    Degrees evaniſhed, becauſe of its Diſtance :
    The like was never ſeen before. From November
    the 2d, till after Epiphany, a hard Froſt, great
    and deep Snow, with ſeveral Rains which
    freezed as they fell, and therefore broke Boughs
    of Trees with the Weight of Ice ; Wind
    North and Eaſt till after the Aſcenſion ; a very
    late Spring. Stow, cum aliis. --- The Plague
    raged over all Poland ; and at Baſil was a
    malignant Fever, chiefly fatal to Men of robuſt
    Conſtitutions ; it rarely ſeized Infants, Women,
    or Children ; Men were taken with a ſudden
    Weakneſs. The Diſeaſe mimicked a continual
    putrid Fever, and was fatal to moſt, who
    before their Death had Spots break out on their
    Bodies, but no Bubos or Carbuncles. The
    Intemperate were ſeized firſt, they died the
    10th, 11th, or 12th Day, rarely reached the
    14th ; ſuch as eſcaped were ſix Weeks before
    they recovered. --- Schenckius ſays, that
    Galen’s Hemitritean began to ſpread in July and
    Auguſt, but chiefly in October ; then ſuch as
    were recovered, relapſed, being terrified at the
    Seaſon over France and lower Germany, ſo
    that it was doubtful whether to define it an
    acute or chronic Diſeaſe. It was mild at
    firſt, but not without ſome Suſpicions of
    Malignity or Putridneſs. The firſt Inſult was with
    a ſlight Horror, and in moſt with a ſmall
    ſhivering Fit ; though ſome few had it not.
    The Continuance of the Diſeaſe was no leſs
    different, being fom the 4th to the 27th
    Day ; and from that again put off to one or
    other of the future critical Days : It miſt not
    a Family, and ſcarce a Perſon, but took all in
    their Turn. Some had two Exaterbations in
    a Day, others one ; but all had it ſeverely
    every other Day, either with Horror or
    Rigour, yet no great Senſe of Cold. Thus it
    went on to the 4th or 17th Day ; in ſome few
    it declined from the Beginning. A wonderful
    Intemperature of the Air preceeded in 1571.
    A Southerly, rainy, cloudy, ugly Harveſt, but
    a much wetter Winter followed, with
    continual Rains, Winds, and Snow, to the middle of
    February, from that ſevere Cold, with a
    conſtant N. or N. E. Wind to the Equinox, dark
    and cloudy, (look back to 1571.) At the ſame
    Time were daily Depredations and Tumults,
    Loſs of all Sorts of Goods. Great Terror filled
    all Breaſts. Women and Poor fell firſt, as
    they were firſt attacked by the Diſeaſe, as alſo
    corpulent Habits. Flegmatic melancholy
    Perſons and Children came off eaſieſt, though
    they afterwards felt its Fury in 1574. The
    Diſeaſe broke firſt out in the Camps, then
    diffuſed itſelf over all Europe. In ſeveral Places the
    Symptoms varied a little from what we ſaid
    in 1571, as ſome had livid Tumours in their
    Legs, or broader Spots like black Bruiſes, or
    Contuſions ; Melancholicks with
    Inflammations redder or blacker, which quickly turned
    to a Gangreen or Mortification. Beſides the
    Symptoms above of this Fever, all had a great
    Malignity of redundant Bile, and fluggiſh
    Flegm. Theſe that had Watchings after the
    9th, 11th, or 14th Day, then fell into a Sleep
    of ſeveral Days, there was great Hopes of
    them, eſpecially were the Sleep was followed
    by a general Sweat ; but where the Watchings
    ended in a Coma, Catalepſis, or Cataphora,
    the Affair was over. Many began favourably,
    but after the 4th or 7th Day went into a great
    Phlogoſis, with a continued or interrupted
    Delirium. Such as began more ſeverely, were
    often in leſs Danger. It was fatal where the
    Toſsings were greateſt on the even Days ; or
    if there was a Diſcharge of good Blood before
    the 7th Day ; or if there were cold Sweats
    between the 4th and 9th Day ; or if ſmall black
    Puſtles appeared ; or if there was a Delirium,
    Tremblings of the Hands and Feet, convulſive
    Pulſe, with Toffings and great Reſtleſneſs,
    Tremors, Incontinence of Urine and Stool, all
    bad. At firſt the Urine was thin, and ſcarce
    tinctured ; then gradually turned brown, or
    bloody, or jet black. Not one recovered
    where it had not a very thick large Sediment
    of Bile or Flegm like Pus or Feces ; though
    this was prevented by a Looſeneſs in many.
    The Urine of many that died, had a black
    Circle, and inſufferable Stench. Some had a
    very ſharp dry Tongue, with deep Chops,
    ouzing out a ſanious Matter. In ſome it was
    inflamed and much ſwelled ; in others ſcaly ;
    in ſome black ; in others green as Leeks ; the
    Urine of the laſt was of the ſame Colour ;
    all ſuch died. Some had the entire Skin peel
    off their whole Tongue, ſo that in cleanſing
    them ſeven or eight Spoonfuls of Skin came
    off in 24 Hours (this was a fatal Sign, and
    happened chiefly to thoſe forbidden the Uſe of
    Wine) like ſmall Chips firſt, then fleſhy, then
    membranaceous, followed the Urine of ſome
    of the Sick ; after that a furaceous Matter ; laſtly,
    ſmall little Corpufcles, as is common in the
    Plague, eſpecially with white and pale Urine. In
    ſome few, after a long Delirium, the Sediment
    of their Urine was firſt a pale red, then more
    bloody, then white, equal and ſmooth. There
    was often a livid black at the Bottom, then
    became gradually clearer and thinner. There
    were ſome whoſe Urine in the middle of the
    Sediment, had a clear tranſparent Space, which
    indicated the Recovery of the Sick, but with
    the greateſt Severity and Danger. The Criſis
    of this Fever was neither ſudden nor perfect,
    but required ſeveral Days to abſolve it ; and
    was herein influenced by the Moon. --- The
    curative Part conſiſted in opening the
    Obſtructions, reſiſting the Virulence of the
    Putrefaction or Malignity ; (for of the many
    Bodies that were opened, either all, or the greateſt
    Part of the Viſcera, were found black as a
    Coal, or full of ſuppurated Puſtles) laſtly, in
    ſtrengthening and ſupporting Nature ; all
    which were beſt obtained by the ſame Method
    judiciouſly diverſified : They gave Decoctions
    of Roots of Aſparagus, Plantin, and wild
    Sorrel, for ſundry Days. The richer Sort had a
    Julep of Simple Oxy-ſacchorine, Syrup of the
    acid Juice of Citron, or Lemons, with Sugar
    of Roſes in Carduus, Betony, or
    Peach-Leaf-Waters, or the like, whereby the Belly
    being gently moved, the Sick had great Relief.
    Strong Purges were fatal, for the Looſeneſs
    could hardly ever be ſtopt, or the dejected
    Spirits raiſed ; therefore Infuſion of Rhubarb,
    with ſometimes Agaric and Senna ; or to
    delicate Bodies, Syrup of pale Roſes, of Rhubarb,
    Caſsia, Manna, or lenitive Electuary, ſtewed
    Prunes, Pill. Ruff. &c. were given two or three
    Times. Moſt that were let Blood of, died, except
    taken the firſt, or at moſt ſecond Day from ſome
    rare Plethorics, or where there was an
    Inflammation. But cupping and ſcarifying of Legs,
    Arms and Shoulders, was very uſeful. They
    had a Diaſcordium, which they found highly
    beneficial ; and Vinegar and Wine, equal Parts,
    mixt, and ſeveral Times diſtilled, and the
    Ingredients of the Diaſcordium infuſed in it ;
    only a greater Quantity of Camphire and Bole
    were added to it. But to the Poor were given
    Decoctions in Whey of wild Sorrel, Wood
    Sorrel, with Currants, &c. In caſe of Worms,
    nothing was found equal to a Powder of Hart’s
    Horn, Coraline, and Rhubarb. Againſt violent
    Pains of the Head, and Fear of a Delirium,
    Ointment of Roſes, Populeon, and white
    Ointment, with Camphire mixt and uſed. For
    exceſsive Watchings, Requies Niolai, with a
    little of ſome moderate Syrup, or the like;
    as Diacordium, Water Lillies, Poppies, and
    Poppy Water. ’Tis ſcarce credible how many were
    cured by a Decoction of Sarſaparilla, prepared
    in a double Veſsel, which reverberated its
    Steam. To ſome a Decoction of Roots of
    Plantin, Eryngo, Aſparagus, Avens, &c. The
    Diaſcordium was near the ſame with that for this
    Fever in 1571. Thus from ſeveral Authors
    in different Countries, we have got a pretty
    good Account of this Fever.

    Says Stow, was a great Dearth in England,
    without Scarcity. September the 4th, at four a
    Clock after Noon, was a terrible, Storm of
    Rain in London. In October and November,
    a great Dearth there, and ſome ſmall
    Plague. Sunday Nov. 14. about Midnight
    ſeveral ſtrange impreſsions of Fire and Smoke
    were ſeen in the Air coming out of a black
    Cloud in the North toward the South, till
    day-light ; next Night, the Heavens in all
    Quarters, ſeemed to be in a raging Flame of
    Fire, which riſing round the Horizon, met in
    the middle, there doubled and rolled as in a
    Furnace. On the 18th at Night, a Hurricane
    came out of the South. After Harveſt the
    Price of Corn fell a little, but Bay-ſalt was
    dearer than ever was known. The Spring was
    like a Summer, the Summer like a Spring ;
    the whole Harveſt like a bad Winter, moſt
    rainy and ſoutherly ; moſt of the Year without
    both Wind and Thunder. Many Exhalations,
    Meteors, &c. were ſeen in the Air. Great
    Porverty, continual Fear, Grief, bad Food, &c.
    The Plague now followed laſt Year’s Fever.
    In this Peſtilence, ſcarce any Symptoms
    happened before the third Day, and even then,
    only ſlight Sleep, moderate Toſsings of the
    Body Vomiting or Looſneſs, Tongue was
    greeniſh coloured, Straightneſs of the Precordia ;
    all which ſcarce exceeded the like Symptoms in an
    Ephemera : At laſt the Spots breaking out
    about the 4th or 7th Day, many being more
    cheerful, walked about, or ſat upright, but
    ſuddenly fell down dead ; and ſome without any
    Fever, but from meer Apprehenſion, or
    outward Effluvia ſucked in, had their whole Body
    inſtantly covered over with Spots the Bigneſs of
    Peas, black or livid, without any
    Inconvenience, Sickneſs or Danger. The Contagion was
    always leſs or more according to the Summer’s
    Heat, but greateſt in the Decreaſe of the
    Moon. Beſides the common Precautions, the
    Method of Cure was near the ſame uſed laſt
    Year. As the Diaſcordium, or Pills,
    mentioned for the ſame Purpoſe, or Ruffius’s Pills, or
    Succotrine Aloes, with Zedoary, Cardomom,
    Mace, Citron, Bark, &c. After theſe
    Lenitives, the above Syrups and Waters were uſed,
    with Bezoar, Coraline, but eſpecially the
    Species of Diaſcordium, moderately taken, were
    good. However, Bleeding for Prevention might
    prove it was found very bad for Cure, except
    in a Phlogoſis. Cupping, Scarification, actual
    Cautery, Bliſters on the Tumours, were all
    found very uſeful and ſucceſsful, as were
    Iſsues and Seatons. For the Swellings behind
    the Ears, (which were worſt of all) Pigeons
    Dung being beaten up with Soap, and laid on
    the Arm directly under it, anſwered well, by
    drawing the Humour to it ; or when the
    Tumour was in the Groin, raiſe an Inflammation
    in the Legs. The Cleanſers did great Service
    to many with this, viz. Rape Oyl, Water, and
    Whites of Eggs, of each a like Quantity ;
    mix and give. Powder of roaſted Nutmeg,
    with a little Salt and Vinegar, was often
    beneficial ; as alſo Camphire one Part, Ginger two
    Parts, Sugar of Roſes four Parts, infuſed in
    Wine, and given : Or rather, take Camphire,
    Dittany of Crete, Scordium, Cinnamon, Roots
    of Angelica, Ginger, Zedoary, of each a Dram;
    Nutmeg two Drams; true Bole half a Dram;
    Mace, Saffron, Rue Seeds, of each a Scruple ;
    Muſk 7 Grains, with Sugar, perfumed Wines
    enough to make like an Opiat. But above all,
    the diſtilled Water from the Ingredients for
    the Diaſcordium, they having been firſt
    infuſed in Wine, and the ſtrongeſt Vinegar, was
    the moſt powerful and effectual. Some
    ſcarified the Bubos, and then cupped on the Top
    of them ; after that laid on Treacle in a
    ſcoped roaſted Onion : Others opened them with
    a hot Iron or a Knife. Some laid on young
    Pigeons, Whelps, or Chickens, cut up alive,
    and laid on hot ; or Pigeons Dung with
    Onions and Treacle, or a ſuppurating Plaiſter
    of Muſtard Seed, white Lilly Roots, Figs and
    Elder Leaves. Some added four Dough,
    Sowbread, black Hellebor Roots, with Juice of
    Scabious, Oyl of Cammomil, and beaten
    Linſeed ; and when it was broke, cured it as
    other Ulcers. The Baſis of Schenckius’s
    Diaſcordium, ſo often mentioned, was, Dittany of
    Crete, Sea Wormwood, Dodder of Time,
    Roſes of Alexandria, Plantin Seed, Pine Nuts ;
    Seeds of Mellon, Lettice, White and Corn
    Poppies, Cucumbers, Gourds. But to have the
    Ingredients lie in narrower Compaſs, Myrrh,
    white Pepper, Nutmegs, Mace, Saffron,
    Cinnamon, Coraline, Wood Aloes, Benzoin, Bole,
    Maſtich, Camphire, Roots of Rhubarb,
    Zedoary, Gentian, Angelica, of each laſt four
    alike. The Pills were of Orrice root, red
    Roſes, Citron Bark, Dittany of Crete,
    Marjoram, of each a Dram ; Styrax Calamita,
    Benzoin, Cinnamon, Cloves, of each two Drams ;
    liquid Styrax, white Saunders, Nutmeg, Mace,
    Zedoary, Angelica, of each a Scruple ;
    Camphire, Cubebs, of each ten Grains ; Muſk,
    Ambergreaſe, of each ſeven Grains ; of the
    pureſt and fineſt Gum Ladanum, with
    Vinegar and Roſe Water, where in is Gum
    Tragacanth diſsolved, enough to make all into a
    Maſs of Pills. Schenchius reſided then at
    Breſlaw.

    In February the Earth began to open at ſix
    a Clock in the Evening, and an Hill, with a
    Rock under it (making at firſt a great
    Bellowing Noiſe, which was heard a great Way
    off) lifted itſelf up a great Height, and began
    to travel, bearing along with it the Trees that
    grew upon it, the Sheep-folds, and Flocks of
    Sheep, abiding there at the ſame Time. In
    the Place from whence it moved, it left a
    gaping Diſtance 40 Foot wide, and 80 Ells

    Paſsing along, it overthrew a Chapel ſtanding
    in its Way, removed a Ewe-Tree growing in
    the Church Yard, from the W. to the E. with
    like Force ; it thruſt before it Highways,
    Houſes, and Trees ; it made tilled Ground

    thus walked from Saturday Evening till
    Monday Noon, it then reſted. Clark’s Exampl.---
    Now general and grievous Pains of the Head
    prevailed, which eluded the Skill of all

    A peſtilential Diſeaſe reigned at Trent,
    Venice, Padua, &c. wherein ſome of the Sick
    voided Worms upward and downward, and
    were more difficultly cured than others. Some
    had Carbuncles, which were neither red nor
    black ; only the Part was very painful, and
    the Skin livid, under which the Carbuncles
    laid ſomewhat deep ; very few eſcaped. Some
    that ſeemed quite recovered, relapſed after
    ſome Months. Black Spots were more fatal
    than either Carbuncles or Bubos. Bleeding
    was hurtful, but Leeches put on the

    12th ; after which no more died, &c. Sennertus
    in Tom. 2d. of his Works, gives a large Syſtem
    of Preſcriptions ordered againſt ſeveral
    Epidemics in his Day, in ſeveral Places of
    Europe, which were given at the Requeſt of the
    Civil Magiſtrates, either by ſome eminent
    Phyſicians alone, or by Conſultation and
    Advice of ſeveral whole Colleges ; as theſe for
    the Epidemic of Egrana, in 1564 ; for that
    of Dreſden in 1566 ; and that of Jena, Anderac,
    and the Republic of Torgen in 1582 ; of
    Dreſden in 1583 ; of Wirtenburg in 1598,
    1609, 10, 18, 26 ; for Breſlaw in 1607 ; for
    Francfort in 1611 ; for Berlin in 1625 ; for
    Tubingen in 1626, &c. which wanting both
    the Hiſtory of the Air and Diſeaſes, I have
    omitted.
    Ludovicus Mercatus, chief Phyſician to
    Philip the IId. of Spain, gives us the Hiſtory of
    an Epidemic, which happened in his Time,
    without Account of either Year or Weather ;
    it raged both in City and Country, and being
    ſcarce either ſeen or known before, was
    commonly called Garotillo, being a ſudden
    fatal Tumour of the Throat and Jaws ; it was
    a ſhort Continuance, and certain Danger ; it
    agreed neither with Quinſy nor French Pox,
    though it partook of the Nature of both ; for
    ſometimes beginning with an Inflammation, it
    quickly ulcerated ; other times beginning with
    a corroſive Ulcer, with ſudden and great
    Defluxion of putrid and malignant Humours, it
    became a Tumour, whoſe Matter quickly ate
    the Fleſh to the Bones ; like that of a
    peſtilential Carbuncle, it ſuffocated the Sick in a
    Day or two ; their Mouth and Breath ſtunk
    ſo intolerably, that none could come near
    them ; and a moſt malignant Fever attended
    it ; nothing was ever more malignant,
    dangerous, or ſuffocating. They had a Difficulty
    of breathing, and often of ſwallowing ; tho’
    when the Mouth was wide opened, there was
    no viſible Tumour to hinder it. They had a
    Pain of the Breaſt and Back, a ſuffocating
    Compreſſion, with a peſtilential Smell, and a
    moſt vehement Heat of all thoſe Parts ; a
    redneſs of the Mouth and Neck, a drawing
    out of the Tongue, a Fault of Speech, with
    an inſatiable Thirſt, and moſt contagious
    withal ; all manifeſt Signs of a moſt terrible
    peſtilential State, far beyond any Quinſy :
    They voided ſanious Matter through their
    Mouth and Noſe. The Ulcers were of ſundry
    Colours, and moſt intolerably fetid. Some had
    the Glands ſwelled outwardly near the Neck,
    or below the Chin, and the whole Neck was
    ſwelled. The moſt ſucceſſful remedies in a
    Quinſy were uſeleſs here, for the Syptoms
    ſtill encreaſed, till they killed the third or
    fourth Day. Blood was let of grown-up
    Perſons by Scarification and Cupping ; and of
    Children, with a Lancet the firſt Day ; then
    gave Alexipharmics in Food, Drink, and
    Phyſick. Within an Hour after Bleeding, they
    gave a Laxative ; then uſed a Gargle of
    ſtrained Decoction of Barley, with Syrup and
    Vinegar of Roſes ; or the acid Juice of
    Pomegrnates in Plantin Water, Roſes and Pomegranate
    Bark, with Syrup of Roſes and Mulberries ;
    But a Decoction of Contragerra Root exceeded
    all. When the Heat was great, they uſed Roſe
    Water with Vinegar of Roſes ; or an
    Emulſion of the cold Seeds in Plantin Water, or
    ſweet Almonds. When Repellents hindered
    not Ulceration and Corroſion, they uſed
    Driers and Alexipharmics, as Plantin, China Root,
    Scordium, Coriander Seeds, with a little Roſe
    Vinegar : if theſe failed, gave them Allom
    Water. Laſtly, they uſed Ung. Egyptiac.

    In 1578, and on April the 6th this Year,
    and May the 12th, were general Earthquakes
    over all England. October the 10th, a Comet
    in the South buſhing toward the Eaſt ; it
    continued from October to January, full two
    Months, Stow. ---- The Weather for ſome
    Years, paſt having been extraordinary moiſt,
    wet, and rainy, Wind South, at the Riſing of
    the Dog Star came a cold dry North Wind.
    From the Middle of Auguſt to the End of
    September, raged a malignant epidemic
    Catarrh ; it began with a Pain of the Head, and
    Feveriſh Heat : Some were diſpoſed to Sleep,
    others to Watching ; preſently followed a dry
    Cough, Pain of the Breaſt, Haſkneſs, and
    Roughneſs of the Throat, Weakneſs of the
    Stomach ; at laſt a terrible Panting for Breath,
    like dying Perſons. Though the Cough laſted
    not long, yet the Panting for Breath continued
    to the 14th Day. Some ſweated, ſuch recovered
    the 30th or 40th Day ; they did not
    expectorate much. With ſome the Diſeaſe went
    off by Stool ; in others by Urine. Though all
    had it, few died in theſe Countries, except
    ſuch as were let Blood of, or had unſound
    Viſcera. Of the firſt died in Rome at this Time
    2000. The Cure conſiſted of repeated
    Lenitives, cooling Inciders, and Pectorals. In other
    Places it appeared ſomewhat different,
    according to varying Conſtitution of the Seaſon.
    In ſundry Places it begun with a
    Wearineſs, Heavineſs, and painful Senſation ; Heat
    and Horrours ſeized the whole Body, chiefly
    the Breaſt and Head, with a dry Cough,
    Hoarſneſs, Roughneſs of the Jaws, Difficulty
    of Breathing, Weakneſs, and Langour of the
    Stomach, Vomiting green Bile, like Juice of
    Leeks ; which Symptoms increaſed with the
    Diſeaſe, as the Fever, Cough, Weight and
    Pain of the Head, pricking Pain of the
    Extremes, Watching, Dryneſs, and Roughneſs of
    the Tongue, and Shortneſs of Breath. At the
    State of the Diſeaſe all theſe were heightened,
    Catarrh, Cough, Spitting. Some had Swellings
    on the Glands of the Throat. In ſome it went
    off by Stool ; in others by Urine or Sweat, or
    bleeding at the Noſe. Some had Spots. With
    ſome it ended in a Pleuriſy, Peripneumony,
    or Conſuption ; All recovered very ſlowly.
    This Diſeaſe raged all over Europe at leaſt,
    and prevailed for ſix Weeks. Yet if in any
    Place it was preceeded by a Drought, Bleeding
    gave the ſpeedieſt and greateſt Relief ; as at
    Montpelier, ſo as not one of a 1000 died of
    it. The ſame Epidemic returned in October
    and November that Year ; then Bleeding, even
    in theſe Places, was hurtful, except when a
    ſpitting of Blood, Pleuriſy, or Peripneumony
    attended it. At the ſame Time a Fever of the
    ſame kind prevailed, which Sennertus ſays,
    reigned all over the World ; and was the ſame
    with that of 1551, as the Cattarh and
    Diſorders of the Breaſt were the ſame with thoſe
    of 1510, 1591, 1597, 1610, &c. over all
    Europe, with a Rheum and Diſtillation from the
    Head, either with or without Fever, Pain
    of the Head, Heavineſs, Hoarſneſs, Weakneſs .
    To thoſe Symptoms this Year, were joined a
    Cough, Pain of the Jaws and Neck.
    Sinnertus, Foreſt, &c.---Says Reverius, after a
    prodigious Plague of Inſects in April and May,
    the like Epidemic broke out and ſtrangled
    many , but where proper Means were uſed,
    all recovered : It began with a Fever and Cough,
    then followed again a Pain of the Head, and
    Loins ; then the Fever intermitted a few Days,
    and returned with freſh Vigour. Some had
    no Reſt, but the Heat increaſing, they died ;
    as ſome did of a Phrenzy, and others of a
    Conſuption ; but ſpeedy proper Means
    ſecured them, viz. Bleeding, Laxatives, and
    Pectorals, Cuppings, cooling Clyſters, cordial
    Opiats, and Epithems. --- Laſtly, let us hear
    Chriſt. Math. From the Corruption, and
    Intemperature of the Air, aroſe an Epidemic,
    which travelled from E. and S. to W. and N.
    for in June it was in Sicily ; in July, in Rome
    and Italy ; in Auguſt, at Venice and
    Conſtantinople ; in September, in Hungary and upper
    Germany, Bohemia and Saxony ; in October, on all
    the Baltick Coaſt ; in November, in Norway ;
    in December, in Denmark, Sweden, Poland and
    Ruſſia. It ſeized very ſpeedily, ſo as all
    People were taken with an Ephemeris, or Cough,
    from a Defluxion of the Breaſt. Many
    before who had been ill of Diſeaſes of the Breaſt,
    died. In the End of July died of this Diſeaſe
    in Rome, 4000 ; at Lubec, in October, 8000 ;
    at Hamburg 3000 ; at Bremen, Brunſwick,
    and Lunenburgh, an infinite Number ; in all
    Countries, Cities, and Families, ſcarce any but
    they were down at once ; only ſome were
    worſe than others, according to the Diverſity
    of Conſtitutions, Ages, Uſe of the
    Non-naturals, &c. Such as uſed no Medicines at all,
    came off better, ſooner, and eaſier than ſuch as
    did. --- In the Summer and Harveſt, ſays
    Balditius, raged an epidemic Diſeaſe,
    commonly called the Male del Caſtrone, or
    Moutone. From France it ſoon overſpread all
    Italy ; it was a continual Fever for four or
    five Days, with a Pain of the Head,
    Straitneſs of the Breaſt, and Cough ; it was
    terminated by a profuſe Sweat ; Bleeding and
    Purging were both hurtful, Sudorifics uſeful ;
    the Sick were allowed Wine, or Wine and Water
    to drink ; few died of it.
    In Grand Cairo 500000 died of the Plague
    in ſix or ſeven Months Time ; it came into
    Egypt from Barbary, which is always the
    fataleſt Plague that enters Egypt, far exceeding
    that from Greece or Syria, which are the only
    three Places whence they have it. It never
    viſits this Country before the latter End of
    September, or Beginning of October ; nor
    continues longer than the Beginning of June ;
    when not only it, but its Contagion is ſaid to
    ceaſe ; ſo that after that, all Infection from
    Cloaths, Houſes, Perſons, Furniture, &c.
    diſcontinues. The ſooner it comes, the ſeverer,
    more fatal, and durable it is ; the later, the
    milder, leſs diffuſive, and ſhorter it is. Of all
    Places in the World, it makes the greateſt
    Havock of People in Grand Cairo, and the Banks
    of the Caleg ; yet the Sick are beſt attended
    in it, and moſt Care taken of, from the
    Mahumedan Doctrine of abſolute Predeſtination,
    that the Number of particular individual
    Perſons ordained to die of this Diſeaſe, with their
    Time and Place of their Death is ſo fixed,
    that the Fate is irreſiſtible, and unavoidable ;
    hence the Sound and Infected live together,
    lye together ; no ſooner is one dead of it, than
    another healthy Perſon dreſſes with the Cloaths
    of the Deceaſed ; and when aF amily dieſ of
    it, their whole Cloaths, and other Goods and
    Furniture, are next Day brought to the open
    Market, and readily ſold off. --- At
    Alexandria many peſtilential mortal Fevers
    abound in the Autumn. Strangers are ſooner
    infected, and in greater Danger from them,
    than the Natives. The Urine, Pulſe, and
    febrile Heat of the Sick differ very little, if at
    all, from the ſame in healthy State. They
    are commonly known thus : They begin with
    much bilious virulent Vomitings, with a
    torturing Pain, and cannot keep any Food on
    their Stomach ; they have conſtant Toſſings and
    Reſtleſneſs, and many have a Looſneſs of thin,
    bilious, moſt fetid Stools of ſundry Colours ;
    they loath Food, and though their Tongues
    are parched, rough, and black, yet they have
    little Thirſt. Beſides the Plague of Cairo, and
    Yearly Fever of Alexandria, the Egyptians
    have ſeveral Epidemics, as Inflammations of
    the Eyes, Leproſy, Elephantiaſis, moſt ſudden
    and fatal Phrenzies, moiſt peſtilent Small Pox,
    Arthritic Pains, all Kinds of Catarrhs, Hernias,
    Stone, Conſumptions, Obſtructions of the
    Abdiminal Viſcera, Weakneſs of the Stomach ;
    Tertian, ardent, hectic, and peſtilential Fevers.
    Of all the Nations, they formerly uſed
    Scarifications of the Legs moſt, and with greateſt
    Succeſs. They did it thus : They handle and
    nib the Parts well, then ſet them in a large
    Veſſel of warm Water, and pour the Water
    often on them with their Hands, and gently
    whip them with ſmall Reeds ; all which they
    repeat ; then tie them under the Ham with a
    Leathern Garter, then rub and handle them
    in the Water, and whip till they are are red ;
    by this Time the Parts are ſtupified that the
    Sick feel little Pain from the Scarifications ;
    then beginning above the Tendo Achillis, they
    ſcarify pretty deep, according to the
    longitudinal Direction of the muſcular Fibres : In the
    firſt Story they make two longitudinal
    Inciſions ; in the ſecond they make three or four ;
    and in the three other Stories, five Slaſhes
    apiece all the Height of the Calf of the Leg :
    This done, they let them ſtand in the Water,
    and waſh and rub all the while ; if they uſe
    it for a particular Place, they ſcarify only one
    Calf ; if for Evacuation, as in a Fever, they
    take both : The common Number of Inciſions
    made in the five Stories on each Leg, is from
    20 to 40, according to the Age and Strength
    of the Sick. Some in their Plague make three
    or four large Wounds in their Calf, each four
    Fingers breadth long, and keep them open
    till the Fever is gone. From theſe Scarifications,
    they take from one to two Pound of Blood ;
    then looſe the Garter, waſh the Legs, rub
    them well down with their Hands dipt in
    Oyl, wrap them up, and in three or four Days
    the Legs are well. They uſe this
    Scarification in all putrid Fevers. This greatly relieves
    the Head, ſo as they ſeldom have violent or
    continual Pains, Watchings, Delirium, Phrenzy,
    or the like. Nor are the Hypochonders ſo much
    diſtended or inflamed. Nor are they ſo liable to
    Toſſings, Reſtleſneſs, Anxiety, Difficulty of, or
    Catching for their Breath, Symptoms too common
    in acute, malignant, peſtilential Fevers ;
    they uſe it in all internal Inflammations, and
    for Childrens Inflammation of their Tonſils
    and Jaws. (But in Infants they ſcarify behind
    the Ears for the laſt.) In the Plague, they with
    good Reaſon, and great Succeſs, fly to the
    four or five deep Slaſhes to be kept open, as
    to the laſt and ſacred Anchor. They ſcarify
    alſo in chronic acute Pains, after Univerſals, and
    in every obſtinate Inflammation, either
    external, or in the Viſcera, on the Part affected, or the
    next to it ; and in Eryſipelas, in prodagric
    Pains, Tumours, and Ulcers, that cicatrice
    difficultly. In Defœdations of the Skin, in
    Bites of mad or venemous Beaſts, they ſtill
    retain the ancient and uſeful Practice of
    Inciſion, ſo much depended on by the Ancients,
    but too much neglected by modern and
    preſent Phyſicians. When they perform the
    Operation, they take a Piece of old Linnen, a
    Cubit long, and three Fingers broad, wrap in
    it a Piece of Goſypium, and with a Silk Thread
    tye it in Form of a Pyramid, and apply its
    broad End to the Part to be burnt, fix it well
    to the Place, put Fire to the narrow End,
    ſuffer it to burn till the Rag and Goſypium are
    burnt away ; and while the Skin is
    burning, they touch the Edges about with an Iron,
    that an Inflammation ariſe not from the Heat ;
    they always make a Hole in the middle of
    the Bundle for the Air to paſs ; when it is
    burned, they dreſs it with Marrow of Bones to
    haſten off the Eſchar, This is the Method of
    Egyptians, Arabians, and others living in Tents.
    They uſe it in all Chronic Pains of the Joynts,
    or other Parts which come from a Defluxion
    of cold Humours, or flatulent Tumours,
    Laxneſs or Weakneſs of the Parts. In the Sciatic,
    Gout of the Hands or Feet ; in all Defluxions
    from the Head, Breaſt, or Lungs, Diſeaſes of
    the Eyes ; in Epilepſies, Palſies, Apoplexies,
    Vertigos, Madneſs, Lethargy, Dulneſs,
    Fooliſhneſs ; they burn the hind Head, Forehead,
    Neck, behind both Ears. In moſt acute Pains
    of the Eyes, Ears, and Teeth, they burn the
    Temples ; as alſo in periodic Pains of the
    Teeth, and Putrefaction of the Gums and
    Teeth. In a Phthyſis and Empyæma, they burn
    the Breaſt, in cold, weak, flegmatic, flatulent
    Stomachs, for Hardneſs or Schirroſity of the
    Spleen, in a Dropſy, in Pains of the Back,
    Loins, Neck and Joynts, and for pituitous
    Tumours. The Uſefulneſs of theſe two
    Operations may apologize for giving the
    Manner nd Uſes of them from Proſp. Alpin. ---- A
    ſtrange Apparition was ſeen in Somerſetſhire,
    60 Perſonages all cloathed in black, a Furlong
    diſtant from their Spectators ; after their
    appearing and tarrying a little while, they
    vaniſhed ; but immediately another ſtrange
    Company in like Manner, Colour, and Number, all
    in bright Armour, which likewiſe encountered
    one another, and ſo diſappeared. Four honeſt
    Men Spectators, made Oath of this before Sir

    This Summer having been exceſſively dry
    and hot, near the End of the Seaſon, a
    malignant enough Dyſentery broke out, raging
    far and near ; it continued all the Harveſt,
    chiefly afflicting Children, and ſeveral Adults ;
    who yet, by ſeaſonable and proper Remedies,
    recovered. Slight Evacuations with Rhubarb,
    and the like Clyſters, were profitable, with
    the Uſe of burnt Hartſhorn, and
    Armenian Bole. The Vulgar uſed Rumax Seeds.
    Wine was injurious becauſe of the Fever that
    attended it. Sometimes to check the
    immoderate Evacuation and Gripes, Opiats were
    uſed. When pure Bile was voided in great
    Quantity, with Loſs of Appetite, Vomiting, and
    Reſtleſneſs of the whole Body, little Hope
    remained. At the ſame Time a malignant
    Fever raged in ſeveral Places. Schenck. --- The
    Dyſentery mentioned above in the 6th or 7th
    Century, that overrun all France in the Reign
    of Childerbert, was attended with a ſtrong
    Fever, with Vomiting, great Pain of the
    Kidneys, a Dulneſs or Heavineſs of the Head or
    Neck. What the Sick ſpit up, was yellow
    or green ; many ſuſpected occult Poiſon in the

    Puſtules ; and it was not unlike, for Cupping,
    with much Flame, being applied to the
    Shoulders or Legs, many were cured by the
    Eruption, or breaking of the Bladders. The
    Cure conſiſted in the Uſe of Alexipharmick

    In the Beginning of the Spring, Pleuriſies
    and Peripneumonies prevailed, not without
    ſome Suſpicion of Malignity ; they began
    with Shivering, and an intenſe Fever ; ſometimes a
    fear of Suffocation, as in a Peripneumony ;
    inſtead of this, ſome had ſhooting Pains in the
    Head, Shoulders, Hinds, and Feet ; and in the
    Loins, Sides, and Breaſt ; after Bleeding, they
    all evaniſhed, except thoſe in the Sides or
    Breaſt Bone ; extending after to the Stomach
    and Hypochonders, with the greateſt Straitneſs
    and Compreſſion of thoſe Parts, and not
    ſeldom a Vomiting ſupervened. Some fell into
    violent Gripes, and Diſtention of the Inteſtines,
    with ſuch Severity as though the Inteſtines
    were cut on both Sides. In theſe
    Difficulties, neither Bleeding, Laxative, nor
    Scarifications, nor other external or internal Remedies,
    proper in a Pleuriſy, availed any Thing ; but
    moſt died on the fourth or ſixth Day on the
    Attack of Suffocation. Moreover, the Diſeaſe
    ſtill continuing, the Urine of moſt was red and
    turbidſ; the Fever was either more gentle or
    ſevere, the Pulſe languid or intermittent. Some
    were delirious before they died. It was
    obſerved, that fewer eſcaped who were let Blood,
    than ſuch as did not let it ; therefore all
    Antipleuritic Methods formerly, and in other
    Places found ſucceſſful, failing in this, it was
    thought to have ſome latent Malignity
    attending it ; but giving a Sweat of Butterbur Root,
    and Corn Poppy Flowers in Carduus Water,

    That extroardinary, epidemic, convulſive,
    contagious Diſeaſe, of Cologn, Weſtphalia, and
    the neighbouring Places, having found Work
    for the Judgment and Pens of ſeveral learned
    Men, as Sennertus, Horſtius, &c. I ſhall throw
    the Sum of all their Hiſtories together. --— In
    1594, in April, May, all the reſt of Summer,
    and Harveſt (Auguſt excepted, which was fair)
    were exceſſive Rains, great Floods, which did
    ineſtimable Hurt ; Corn was very dear. In
    1595 and 1596, was great Scarcity and Dearth,
    with profound ſhocking Rains, and great
    Floods. There raged a ſore Famine over all
    Italy, and reached Germany, which forced
    People to eat uncommon and unwholſome Food,
    as green Hedge Crabs, Muſhrooms, Dogs, Cats,
    Reptiles, &c. In 1596 and 1597, in the
    Dioceſe of Cologn and Weſtphalia, in the Counties
    of Waldeck, Wittenſtein, Heſſen, &c. raged a
    malignant Fever, with Convulſions, Ravings,
    &c. with or without a Fever ; it ſeized in the
    following Manner, firſt the Sick felt a pricking
    or tickling like the Motion of Ants, under the
    Skin of their Feet or Hands, or ſometimes
    both ; ſometimes in one Side, ſometimes in
    both ; then ſuddenly their Fingers or Toes
    were violently contracted, or forcibly extended
    without Strength or Motion, as though they were
    ſtiff or frozen ; then the Convulſions
    roſe from the Hands and Feet to the Legs,
    Thighs, Hips, Arms, and Shoulders, and ſo to
    the reſt of the whole Body, till the Sick were
    either rolled together like a Hedgehog or Ball,
    or extended ſtiff at whole Length like a dead
    Corps or Piece of Wood. This Contraction
    or Extenſion continued in this manner during
    the whole Time of the Fit in ſome ; but it
    often ſeized them alternately, ſo that the
    Member juſt now extended and ſtiff, would
    preſently be rolled up like a Ball, and then
    inſtantly pulled and extended again. This
    Convulſion was often in the Hands only, or in the
    Arms, or in both ; frequently it was in the
    Mouth, Lips, Eyes, or whole Body. This
    Contraction laſted a long or ſhort Time, till its
    Cauſe was diſcuſſed or ſpent ; then the Joints
    were at reſt, till a new Steam or Vapour roſe
    to diſturb and twitch the Nerves afreſh. If the
    peſtilential Cauſe was in the Head, then the
    ſpinal Marrow being drawn into Conſent, the nervous
    Syſtem over the whole Body was
    violently contracted in a Moment ; but if in the
    Hands or Feet, or both, or in any one Part,
    then they only were contracted or extended.
    So excruciating and terrible was the Pain
    attending theſe Convulſions, that the hideous
    piercing Screighs of the Sick, were heard nine
    or ten Houſes off in Villages, and at a great
    Diſtance in the Field, ſo as Byſtanders could
    not bear to hear them. Their conſtant
    Outcry was to have the contracted Part extended,
    or the extended Part contracted. The Sick
    felt either a Senſe of Cold, like Ice Water ; or
    of Heat, like Fire running over their whole
    Body ; hence ſeveral fell into burning Fevers.
    The Diſeaſe gave not the leaſt previous Notice
    of its Seizure ; ſo ſudden was it, that ſome
    were ſtruck at Table eating, ſome at Plow,
    ſome in the Fields, ſome in the Woods, or any
    other Buſineſs : Some at firſt threw up much
    Water or Flegm, without any Complaint of
    their Stomach or Belly. When the Diſtemper
    began in the extreme Parts, it reſted in them
    only, without attacking the Head for ſix, eight,
    or ten Days ; nay, in ſome for ſome Weeks, or
    Months, if fit Remedies were uſed ; but if
    neglected, it got to the Head, and became a
    terrible and fatal Epilepſy, of which many
    laid as dead for ſix or eight Hours ; and
    except taken in the Evening, many were buried
    in the Fit. Several it rendered fooliſh, ſtupid,
    lethargic, or delirious ; the Flegmatic were all
    lethargic, or became fooliſh, threw their Food
    on the Dunghil, their Excrements in the
    Room where they laid, and thruſting their
    Cloaths, or what came in their Way, into
    them. This Sillyneſs continued three or four
    Days or longer. The Melancholy were
    fearful, waked out of their Sleep with Frights,
    and deſiring Solitude, got out of Bed, either
    naked or in their Shirts, run into Fields,
    Woods, or Rivers, and lurked there, till by
    Craft they were ticed back. The Bilious and
    Sanguine being angry, furious and impatient,
    ruſhed in upon their Neighbours, would find
    ſome body that they reputed a Beaſt or Devil,
    and hated, and curſe the Byſtanders ; ſome
    plucked the Eyes out of their Parents or
    Relations Heads ; many were ſo mad, that there
    was a Neceſſſity to chain them before they
    died. But ſuch as had a good Conſtitution
    before they fell ill, were not fierce, but only
    laughed, talked, were merry, or ſhowed
    Antics. Though all were delirious after the
    Epilepſy, ſome few were ſo before it. This
    Perturbation of Mind continued in ſome three or
    four or more Days ; in others a very long Time ;
    and though when come out of the Fit they
    returned to their former Mind, yet they lived,
    behaved, and Walked like drunken People,
    going with a high Step, and throwing their
    Legs ſtrangely and fooliſhly ; nor did they
    remember any Thing that had paſt in the
    Fit, nor complained of any paſt or preſent
    Pain of the Head. Theſe Doatings rarely went
    off without leaving ſome Taint or Mark, as
    Dulneſs of the Hearing, Tingling of the Ears,
    Dimneſs of Sight, and ſometimes both. Some
    were ſo weakened with the Diſeaſe, that they
    had no Uſe of the Parts, but were fed like
    Children. After the Fit, the Sick had a moſt
    voracious and inſatiable Appetite, and
    Longing for ſeveral Meats, as though their
    Hunger could never be ſatiſfied, nor they eat
    enough. When they had Plenty given them,
    they gorged down, and conſumed incredible
    Quantities, without any after Load,
    Compreſſion, or Uneaſineſs. In the Courſe of this
    Disſaſe, a Diarrhea began, and afflicted them
    till the whole morbific Matter was ſpent. The
    leſs they ate, the ſeverer the Looſneſs. Alſo
    in Proceſs of Time, the Hands and Feet of
    moſt ſwelled ; and on their Toes and Fingers,
    were great Bliſters full of Ichor, which being
    opened, much Water run down their Fingers
    without any Relief. Some had ſmall Sweats.
    All that had the Epilepſy, had Fits of it
    return as long as they lived. Such as doated,
    were delirious, raging, or furious, never
    recovered their former Judgment or Diſcretion,
    but were fooliſh, and ſilly, though they lived
    15 or 16 Years after. At the ſame Time of
    the Year, viz. in December and January, in
    the ſharp and cold froſty Winter, they fell
    ſuddenly into the ſame deplorable State, or run
    out into the Fields, or threw themſelves into
    Rivers, whereby many were loſt Yearly before
    they could be found. Though this Diſeaſe
    was neither eaſily cured, nor quickly
    overcome, yet where it had not taken deep Root,
    nor continued long, it was not only curable,
    but by proper Care, ſuch as had ſuffered long
    and much, might obtain ſuch a Truce, as
    rendered the Remainder of their Life
    comfortable. Few that lived in the ſame Houſe, and
    converſed freely with the Infected, eſcaped this
    terrible Contagion either in one Shape or
    another, as Dyſentery, Diarrhea, Convulſions, &c.
    But the Time of Infection was very different,
    according to the Conſtitution, and former Way
    of Life, as from one to twelve Months, or in
    ſome even at two Years End. Such as in
    Time had proper Remedies, moſtly recovered
    to their former State. The Diſeaſe, and all its
    Symptoms, were more frightful and fatal to the
    Poor than to the Rich ; to the Intemperate and
    Irregular, than to the Sober and Regular ; the
    laſt were alſo ſooner, eaſier, and fullier cured
    than the firſt. Publick Care was taken that
    all ſhould have ſufficient Diet of good Juice,
    and eaſy Digeſtion, as Beef, Veal, Mutton,
    Hens, Capons, Turkies, Partridges, Birds of
    Mountains and Woods, good Wheat, or
    Oatmeal, Apples, Pears, Prunes, or the like,
    boiled, and often taken with aromatic or
    carminative Herbs, either eaten in Sauces, Broths,
    or alone ; and either good Wine, or fine Ale
    to drink. They were to avoid Paſſions of
    Mind, Venery, Pork, Bacon, Beef of old
    Cattle, Fiſh of all Kinds, Peaſe, Beans, Nuts,
    Cheſnuts, raw Apples, or Pears, Onions,
    Muſtard, Garlick, Leeks, Horſe Raddiſh, Cheeſe,
    new, dead or ſtale Ale, corrupt or ſtagnant
    Waters, too rich or old Wines. They were to
    ſhun South Wind and Cold, and to procure clean
    warm dry Air, by burning in their Rooms
    Juniper, Lavender, Sage, Thyme, Maſtich,
    Frankincenſe, Betony, Roſemary, &c. The
    medicinal Courſe was begun with Laxatives, and the
    Body was to be kept open by one every 6th
    or 8th Day ; a Sweat was to be given once
    every Fortnight ; a Purge was given daily the
    firſt two or three Days, according to the
    Patient’s Strength and Age. Then they gave the
    Convulſive Powder ſix or ſeven Days ; then a
    Purge ; then the Powder again for 14 Days.
    But if the Cure was begun immediately before
    full or new Moon, they began with the
    Powder firſt ; then purged, and gave ſome Doſes
    of the Powder every Phaſe of the Moon for
    ſeveral Moons after, and repeated the whole
    Courſe every December and January as at
    firſt, and ſometimes a Sweat. The
    Preſcriptions for the Purge, convulſive Powder, and
    convulſive Antidote were, 1. The purging

    after the Purge, and at Night, ſeaſoned with
    wild Thyme, Savory, Roſemary, Sage ; and in
    December and January, for Prevention, beſides
    the convulſive Powder, they uſed Peony Roots,
    Elecampane, Sage, Rue, Juniper-berries,
    Cummin Seeds, &c. --— For the Cure of the
    Symptoms ; 1. Hunger : They gave often, and
    ſparingly, of the above Meats, very fat. If the
    Stomach was acid, or pall’d with much Phlegm,
    they gave a mild Peuk. 2. Vomiting: If from
    too much Food, it was allowed more
    ſparingly ; if from a Load of bad Humours there, it
    was not ſtopt ſuddenly, except it occaſioned
    Weakneſs, then they applied a Pultice of Wine,
    Rye Bread, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Cloves, and
    Quinces ; and gave for Drink, Wheat Bread
    Toaſt, rubb’d with Nutmeg, and dipt in Wine,
    with Sugar. --- 3. Looſneſs : This was by no
    means to be quickly ſtopt, but rather to be
    encouraged ſome Days by the Uſe of the two
    firſt Electuaries, either till it ceaſed, or
    weakened the Perſon ; then they uſed Steel very
    often heated, and quenched in their Drink, or
    Rice Gruel, or Milk, and Quinces, or
    preſerved or dried Sloes, or a Dram of ſealed Earth,
    Bole, Nutmeg, or burnt Hartſhorn, &c.-----
    4. Swelling of the Parts : Beſides the Uſe of
    the Electuary, they diſcuſſed it with a Lee of
    Vine Aſhes, or of Birch, Beech, or Oak Aſhes,
    wherein were boiled Origanum, Calamint,
    and Chickweed ; and fomented daily with
    theſe, boiled Herbs in a Bag, and anointed
    after with Oyl of Caſtor or Walnut. --— The
    Diſcharge of Lee from Toes and Fingers, was let
    alone to great Advantage ; but, if needful,
    Furnace or Oven Aſhes, with Cream, were applied.
    --- 6. Feveriſh Heat was moſtly taken off by
    the Purging and Electuary, but if it reſiſted
    them, the Sick had their Meat boiled with
    Lettice, Endive, Cichory, Wood Sorrel, Vine
    Leaves, &c. or gave Powders of them often,
    or applied Leaves of Water Lillies to the Liver
    and Kidneys. --- 7. The Epilepſy : The Parts
    were ſo held as to be moved a little, neither
    violently bended, nor extended, but well
    rubbed and wrapt up with Cloaths ; and Rue,
    Caſtor, Lavender, wild Thyme, or Origanum, held
    to the Noſe, and half a Spoonful of their Juice,
    Wine, or Infuſion, drunk, &c. Its ſurprizing
    they tried not the Uſe of Bathing in tepid
    Water for theſe Convulſions ; for I do avouch,
    upon a 30 Years Experience of its Efficacy, in
    Spaſmodit, Convulſive, Epileptic, Scoibutic,
    Calculous, and ſeveral other Kinds of moſt
    terrible diſtracting Pains, and Contractions. The
    whole Circle of Medicine falls unſpeakably
    ſhort of its Succeſs, and that very often
    inſtantaneous ; but never ſuffer the Water to be
    warmer than new Milk ; the Patient to ſit in
    it uncovered from 10 to 40 Minutes, and
    repeat its Uſe as they can bear it. --- 8. The
    Apoplectic Symptom : When the Sick laid
    quite ſtiff, with ſcarce any viſible Life, they
    let Blood from their Arm, from 12 to 16
    Ounces, in a ſmall Stream, at ſeveral ſhort
    Intervals, laying the Thumb a little each Time
    on the Orifice ; for though this Symptom
    required Bleeding, the Diſeaſe forbid it ; then put
    Ligatures on the Extremes, gave ſome proper
    diſtilled Waters, and laid a Cataplaſm on the
    Feet, injected ſtimulant Clyſters, and uſed
    Friction to all the Extremes ; then bathed the
    Body with Wine, and put Fumigations under
    the Noſe. --- 9. The Lethargy, out of which
    they were ſcarcely to be rouzed : Sharp
    Clyſters were injected, the Noſe rubb’d with the
    above Aromatics, and the Head fomented with
    a Decoction of them in Wine and Vinegar.
    Water and Vinegar, with Sage and
    Juniper-berries bruiſed, were thrown on hot Bricks of
    Flint Stones near the Beds of the Sick ; and
    kindled Oak Sticks were put under their Necks
    to excite Pain. --- 10. In Madneſs, Stupor, or
    Delirium, they gave the purging Electuary two
    Days together, then raiſed a Diaphoreſis with
    the convulſive Powder, and by all Means
    induced Sleep.--11. For the Pain of the convulſed
    Parts, after Purging and Sweating, they were
    bathed with ſoftening Oyls, or Wine, or both
    mixt. --- 12. For a Palſy of the Parts, after
    Purging and Sweating, for the firſt eight or ten
    Days, rub the Parts with Oyl of ſweet
    Almonds, Woman’s Milk, and the Marrow
    of Veal Bones, mixt ; for the next eight or ten
    Days, they anointed with wild Cats Greaſe,
    and a little Caſtor, or its Oyl, with the
    Mucilage of Linſeed, mixt. --— Laſtly, Oyl of Eels,
    Foxes, and Oyl of Lillies, of each equal Parts,
    Earth Worms bruiſed in them and ſtrained,
    then add Wine, and boiled away till the
    Wine was ſpent : If theſe ſucceeded not at
    firſt, they deſiſted a little from uſing them,
    then they did well ; or naturally hot Baths
    relieved. --- 13. For Dulneſs of Hearing, and
    Dimneſs of Sight : After Purging and
    Sweating, Time wore both theſe and the other
    Symptoms off. --— Great Rains, Dearth, and
    Scarcity, this Year in England.

    Pegu, one of the richeſt, and fruitfuleſt
    Countries of the World, yet its Metropolis,
    lately repleniſhied with Millions of Inhabitants,
    was waſted by a terrible Famine from War,
    that ſcarce 7000 Men, Women, and Children,
    were left alive ; and theſe were fed on human
    Fleſh ; Parents ate Children, and Children
    Parents ; the Stronger ate up the Weaker. Clark’s
    Examples. --— Says Cole, in the Foro Julii,
    Wolves leaving off to prey on Beaſts, killed
    many Children and Men. This Summer was
    exceſſive Heat and Drought ; Swarms of Fleas,
    Flies, and Gnats, abounded ; as did great
    Plenty of Armenian Apples. Tertians, with
    Spots, and continual Fevers, invaded ; which
    were readily cured by Bleeding, Purging, or a
    bilious Diarrhea. But the Heat encreaſing
    with the Spring and Summer, more ardent
    Fevers, Spots, Worms, Diarrheas, and Vomitings,
    came on ; but Bleeding cured them.
    Smallpox and Meaſles, became epidemic among
    Children ; though the Symptoms were bad,
    yet they moſtly recovered. In the Beginning
    of Harveſt, the Plague, with a Synochus
    Fever ſet in, with Worms, and an exulcerating
    Diarrhea ; ſuch as had a ſtrong Pulſe at the
    Beginning, Watery Urine, and a great Pain of
    the Head, eſcaped, by the Help of Syrup and
    Water of Sorrel after Bleeding. But Bubos
    appearing, (which are always milder than
    Anthraces) the Skin cut, and Pieces of white
    Hellebore Root put in, in the extreme Parts,
    were very uſeful. Where the Urine was moſtly
    turbid on the third Day, they died the fourth.
    Near the End the Pulſe was obſcure and
    weak. Neither Bezoar, nor the Armenian Stone,
    were of any Service here. A ſore Plague
    raged in London, Lichfield, and Leiceſter, &c.

    Juſtus Lipſius tells of a Drought this Year
    of four Months Continuance. Epiſt. Seluc. 47.

    another September the 7th. Trees were loaded with Fruit,

    and ſtrictly. Such as had a Pulſe like healthy
    Perſons, the Urine good, with a Syncope,
    the Extreams cold, but parched up within,
    all died the 6th or 7th Day, with all that were
    blooded or purged. Cole. A great Plague

    contagious, but epidemic from the Air. Cole.
