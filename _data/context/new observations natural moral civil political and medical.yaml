    We come to another Kind of Meteors,
    called Aurora Boreales, Lumen Zodiacum, or
    Northern Lights ; these are no Upſtarts, they
    have been long known. Andreas Celſus,
    Professor of Aſtronomy at Upſal, pronounces them
    co-eval with the Arctic Pole, having been
    always common in Iceland, Greenland, Lapland
    and Norway. Our Saxon Chronologers took
    early Notice of them in Britain, but moſtly
    leſſer than the Concluſion of the last and
    Beginning of this Century have produced. Theſe
    taken notice of in Britain, Denmark, Sweden,
    Germany, and ſometimes in France, Spain and
    Italy, have been greater, and ſeem periodical ;
    from 1560 to 1580, they were very common ;
