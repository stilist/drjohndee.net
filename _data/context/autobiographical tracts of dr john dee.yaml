    ANNO 1542. I was (in November) sent by my father, Rowland
    Dee, to the Universitie of Cambridge, there to begin with logick,
    and so to proceede in the learning of good artes and sciences (for I
    had before, in London, and at Chelmisford, been metely well
    furnished with understanding of the Latine tongue) : I being then
    somewhat above fifteene yeares old, as being borne A. 1527, July 13.

    In the yeares 1543, 1544, 1545, I was so vehemently bent to
    studie, that for those yeares I did inviolably keepe this order ; only
    to sleepe four houres every night ; to allow to meate and drink (and
    some refreshing after) two houres every day ; and of the other
    eighteen houres all (except the tyme of going to and being at
    divine service) was spent in my studies and learning.

    After I was Batchellor of Art, I went beyond the seas (anno
    1547 in May) to speake and conferr with some learned men, and
    chiefely mathematicians, as Gemma Frisius, Gerardus Mercator,
    Gaspar à Mirica, Antonius Gogava, &c. And after some moneths
    so spent about the Low Countries, I returned home, and brought
    with me the first astronomer’s staff of brass, that was made of
    Gemma Frisius’ devising, the two great globes of Gerardus
    Mercator’s making, and the astronomer’s ring of brass, as Gemma
    Frisius had newly framed it ; and they were afterwards by me left
    to the use of the Fellowes and Schollers of Trinity College : some
    proofe hereof may appeare by the letters of Mr. John
    Chistoferson, who afterwards was Byshop of Chichester elect.
    In this yeare of 1547, I began to make observations (very many
    to the houre and minute) of the heavenly influences and operations
    actuall in this elementall portion of the world. Of which sort I
    made sorne thousands in the yeares then following : as may appeare
    by my owne writing in my Ephemerides, and in sundry other bookes
    purposely recorded and here lying before your Honor.
    I was out of St. John’s Colledge chosen to be Fellow of Trinity
    Colledge, at the first erection thereof by King Henry the Eight.
    I was also assigned there to be the Under-Reader of the Greeke
    tongue, Mr. Pember being the chiefe Greeke Reader then in
    Trinity Colledge. Hereupon I did sett forth (and it was seene of the
    University) a Greeke comedy of Aristophanes, named in Greek
    Εἰρήνη, in Latin, Pax ; with the performance of the Scarabeus his
    flying up to Jupiter’s pallace, with a man and his basket of victualls
    on her back : whereat was great wondring, and many vaine reportes
    spread abroad of the meanes how that was effected. In that Colledge
    also (by my advise and by my endeavors, divers waies used with
    all the other Colledges) was their Christmas-Magistrate first named
    and confirmed an Emperor. The first was one Mr. Thomas Dunne,
    a very goodly man of person, stature, and complexion, and well
    learned also. They, which yet live, and were hearers and beholders,
    they can testifie more, then is meete here to be written of these my
    boyish attemptes and exploites scholasticall.

    Anno 1548. I was made Master of Arte, as may appeare by the
    Universitie’s testimonie under their seale, lying here on the table.
    In the yeare 1548, I went over beyond the seas againe, and never
    after that was I any more studient in Cambridge : as may appeare
    by the whole course of my lyfe after that, manifestly testified by
    the letters and other recordes here before you.

    I became a student at Lovayne A. 1548, at midsomer, and
    there I made aboad, till the 15 of July A°. 1550 ; as appeareth by
    the notes of my Ephemeredes, and divers letters sent to me from
    divers partes, as being knowne to be at Lovayn then.

    Beyond the seas, far and neere, was a good opinion conceived of my
    studies philosophicall and mathematicall. First, from Lovayne did
    the favourable fame of my skill in good literature so spread, that
    thereupon divers noblemen (Spaniardes, Italians, and others) came
    from the Emperour Charles the Vth, his court at Bruxelles to
    visit me at Lovayne, and to have some proofe of me by their owne
    judgementes : so came the Duke of Mantua to me : so came Don
    Luys de la Cercla, afterwardes Duke cle Medina Cœli in Spaine, unto
    me : so came to me, after them, from the Emperour’s court at
    Bruxells, the honourable Sir William Pykering, Knight, and there
    with me remained sorne tyme, and of me was instructed in logick,
    rhetorick, arithmetick, in the use of the astronomer’s staff, the use
    of the astronomer’s ringe, the astralabe, in the use of both globes,
    &c.
    Thither came sorne out of Bohemia unto me, with strange and
    no vulgar opinion, settled in their imaginations, of my skill, as may
    appeare by the Record of some part of the History in my
    Ephemerides noted.
    Thither came some out of Denmarke unto me, as Mathias
    Hacus, Danus, Regis Daniæ Mathematicus ; Joannes Capito,
    Medicus Regis Daniæ, and a good mathematician also ; as by letters
    lying on the table is evident.
    There I did, for recreation, look into the method of the civile
    law, and profited therein so much, that in antimonys, imagined to
    be in the law, I had good hap to finde out (well allowed of) their
    agreementes ; and also to enter into a plaine and due understanding
    of divers civill lawes, accounted very intricate and darke. Of that
    my study in the law your honor hath on the table the testimonie of
    the University of Lovayne ; and by other letters unto me about
    that time it may appear.

    From Lovayne I tooke my journey towardes Paris A. 1550, the
    15 day of July, and came to Paris the 20 day of that moneth.
    Where, within a few daies after (at the request of some English
    gentlemen, made unto me to doe somewhat there for the honour of
    my country) I did undertake to read freely and publiquely Euclide’s
    Elements Geometricall, Mathematicè, Physicè, et Pythagoricè ; a
    thing never done publiquely in any University of Christendome.
    My auditory in Rhemes Colledge was so great, and the most part
    elder then my selfe, that the mathematicall schooles could not hold
    them ; for many were faine, without the schooles at the windowes,
    to be auditors and spectators, as they best could helpe themselves
    thereto. I did also dictate upon every proposition, beside the
    first exposition. And by the first foure principall definitions
    representing to the eyes (which by imagination onely are exactly to
    be conceived), a greater wonder arose among the beholders, than
    of my Aristophanes Scarabeus mounting up to the top of
    Trinity-hall in Cambridge ut supra. Of this mathematical reading very
    many testimonies lye here before you.
    In that University of Paris, were at that tyme above forty
    thousand accounted studientes ; some out of every quarter of
    Christendome being there. Among these very many of all estates and
    professions were desirous of my acquaintance and conference, as
    Orontius, Mizaldus, Petrus Montaureus, Ranconetus, Danesius,
    Jacobus Sylvius, Jacobus Goupylus, Turnebus, Straselius,
    Vicomercatus, Paschasius Hamelius, Petrus Ramus, Gulielmus
    Postellus, Fernelius, Jo. Magnionus, Johannes à Pena, &c. as by
    letters lying on the table may partly appeare.
    There I refused to be one of the French kinge’s mathematicall
    readers, with 200 French crownes yearely stipend offred me, if I
    would stay for it ; I refused likewayes a good stipend of
    Monsieur Babeu ; and a better than that, of Monsieur de Rohan ; and
    a better than that, of Monsieur de Monluc, who was then sent
    ambassadour to the Great Turk.
    And not only in Lovayne and Paris Universities hath God sent
    me good credit and estimation with the favour and love of very
    many (noble lovers of good learning, or well learned themselves),
    but also in Orleans, Collen, Hædelberg, Strasburg, Verona,
    Padoa, Ferrara, Bononia, Urbino, Roma, and (to conclude herein)
    in many other universities, cities, and townes of Christendome ; as
    may appeare by the multitude of letters and other recordes lying
    here to be seene and perused in this case ; from anno 1547 till and
    in this present yeare of 1592.
    To be most briefe therefore as concerning my forraine credit, it
    may suffice me, a poore studious gentleman, for my forraine credit
    for ever ; that in this tract of my studious race I might have
    served five Christian Emperors ; namely, Charles the Fifth,
    Ferdinand, Maximilian, this Rodulph, and this present Moschovite : of
    everyone their stipendes directly or indirectly offered, amounting
    greater each, then other ; as from 500 dollars yearely stipend to a
    1000, 2000, 3000 ; and lastly, by a Messenger from this Russian or
    Moschovite Emperor, purposely sent, with a very rich present, unto
    me at Trebona castle, and with provision for the whole journey
    (being about 1200 myles from the castle, where I lay) of my
    coming to his court at Moskow (with my wife, children, and my
    whole family) there to enjoy at his Imperial handes £2000 sterling
    yearely stipende ; aud of his protector yearely a thousand rubbles ;
    with my diet also to be allowed me free out of the Emperour’s owne
    kitchin : and to be in dignity with authority amougst the highest
    sort of the nobility there, and of his privy-councellors, &c. Of this
    last great preferment offered, many Englishmen, yet living, and in
    this kingdome, be witnesses : the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassell his
    letter is ready to be shewed, and other letters of men of credit can
    be sufficient testimonie ; besicles the forerunner to seek me, and the
    embassadours or messengers, their owne writings thereof here lyes.
    Note, the Commissioners jointly read two of the testimonies of
    the Moscovite’s great offers and promise.
