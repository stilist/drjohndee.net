        It maie be demed in the iudgement of the worlde, a great presumptiō in
        {{ "Shakelton, Francis" | person_tag: "me" }}
        (right Honourable) thus vnaduisedly to aduēture the discours of this late
        blazing Starre, whiche appeared in
        <time datetime=1580-10-10>the <abbr>ⅹ.</abbr> daie of October laste 1580</time>.
        whereof verie small (or rather no accompt at all) is made emong the
        vulgare sort, for that it hath not altogether suche splēdant brightnesse,
        and glisterying radiation, as some other Cometes heretofore haue had. I
        knowe (I say) I shalbe launced with the bitter reproofes and Zoilous
        reprehensions of certaine fine mouthed mates, who looke for finer
        phrases, and more mellow and sugred sentences, then my poore skill or
        habilitie will aford. My onely drift herein (right Honourable) is to
        disswade the worlde, from freezing in the dregges of their synnes, by
        admonisheyng them of the finall disollution of the Engine of this worlde,
        and second commyng of Christ in the cloudes, which by many manifest and
        ineuitable reasons J gather, can not bee farre of. Jn respecte whereof,
        accordyng to the duetie of my profession, J exhort all men to awake out
        of their slepe by earnest repentance, whiche is the perfecte and plain
        path waie to auert Goddes iuste plagues, deseruedly threatened vnto vs.

        So often as there hath been at any time sene eclipses of the Sōne or the
        Moone, either any Comette, or blasyng Starre in any parte of the Heauen:
        Those that are Christians, haue forthwith been taught by Christ hymself
        to lifte vp their heades, knowyng that their redeption draweth night
        (that is to saie) Christians are admonished thereby, that the daie of
        Iudgement is at hande: When thei shall see the Sonne of manne comyng in
        the Cloudes with power and greate glorie, to iudge the quicke and the
        deade, and to giue to euery man accordyng to his deedes, that thei haue
        doen in their bodies, be thei good or euill. Whose comming shalbe (as
        Peter saith) as a theefe in the night: In the which daie, the Heauen
        shall pass awaie with a noyce, and the Elementes shall melte with heate,
        and the yearth with the workes that are therein shall bee burnt vp (which
        is as muche to saie) that all the worlde shall bee consumed, according to
        the saiyng of our Sauiour Christe: Heauen and yearth shall passe awai,
        but my wordes shall not passe awaie.<ins>…</ins>
