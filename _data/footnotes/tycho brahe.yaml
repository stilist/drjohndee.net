        Before proceeding to pass in review
        the book
        which
        {{ "Brahe, Tycho" | person_tag: "Tycho" }}
        prepared on this comet, we shall shortly allude to the other comets
        observed
        {{ "Ven, Sweden" | place_tag: "at Hveen" }}.
        <time datetime=1580-10-10>On the 10th October 1580</time>
        Tycho found a comet in the constellation Pisces. It was observed
        {{ "Ven, Sweden" | place_tag: "at Hveen" }}.
        <time datetime="1580-10-10/11-25">till the 25th November</time>,
        and again after the perihelium passage
        <time datetime=1580-12-13>on the morning of the 13th December</time>.
        The observations are more numerous and better than those of the
        previous comet
        <ins><time datetime="1577-11-01/1578-01-26">of 1577</time></ins>,
        and time determinations with a quadrant were made nearly every night,
        while there are very few quadrant observations of the comet.
        {{ "Maestlin, Michael" | person_tag: "Moestlin" }}
        had seen it already
        <time datetime=1580-10-02>on the 2nd October</time>,
        and both he and
        {{ "Hájek, Tadeáš" | person_tag: "Hagecius" }}
        observed it assiduously, but their observations are worthless compared
        with
        {{ "Brahe, Tycho" | person_tag: "Tycho" }}’s.
