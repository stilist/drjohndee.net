    Just above this relation some one has written, “ you that rede this
    underwritten assure yourselfe that yt is a shamfull lye, for Talbot neither
    studied for any such thinge nor shewed himselfe dishonest in any thinge.”
    Dr. Dee has thus commented upon it: — “This is Mr. Talbot or that lerned man,
    his own writing in my boke, very unduely as he cam by it.” There are
    several other notices of Talbot erased, but whether by him or by the Doctor
    it is impossible to say, but most probably the former.
