    It is almost unnecessary to observe that this and the following are notes of
    nativities. They are not for the most part contemporary notices, but apparently
    inserted at various times by Dee when professionally consulted as an astrologer.

    ” Anno 1555, Aug. 1, hora quarta a meridie Wigorniæ natus Dominus Edouardus
    Kelæus,” MS. Ashm. 1788, fol. 140, where there is a horoscope of this nativity in
    the handwriting of Dr. Dee. Ashmole, in his MS. 1790, fol. 58, says “ Mr. Lilly
    told me that John Evans informed him that he was acquainted with Kelly’s sister in
    Worcester, that she shewed him some of the gold her brother had transmuted, and that
    Kelly was first an apothecary in Worcester.”

    ” Dr. Dee dwelt in a house neere the water side, a little westward from the church
    [at Mortlake]. The buildings which Sir Fr. Crane erected for working of tapestry
    hangings, and are still (1673) employed to that use, were built upon the ground whereon
    Dr. Dee’s laboratory and other roomes for that use stood. Upon the west is a square
    court, and the next is the house wherein Dr. Dee dwelt, now inhabited by one Mr.
    Selbury, and further west his garden. — MS. Ashm. 1788, fol. 149. The same
    account says that “ Dr. Dee was wel beloved and respected of all persons of quality
    thereabouts, who very often invited him to their houses or came to his.”

    This of course is his celebrated Monas Hieroglyphica, frequently printed, and the
    nature of which I attempted to explain in a paper read before the Society of
    Antiquaries. Mr. Herbert, according to MS. Ashm. 1788, “ dwelt then in Mortlack and was
    an intimate friend of Dr. Dee’s.”

    This was his work printed in 1577 under the title of General and Rare Memorials
    pertayning to the perfect Art of Navigation, in folio, now a book of the greatest rarity.
    The original manuscript of it is in MS. Ashm. 1789, and Dee’s own copy of the
    published work with MS. notes and additions is preserved in the British Museum. In his
    Letter Apologetical, 4to. Lond. 1603, he cites this work under the title of The Brytish
    Monarchie, as having been written in the year 1576.

    Dee has occasionally made use of Greek letters for the preservation of his notes,
    still retaining the English language. The present passage may as well be
    given : — “ This night my wife dreamed that one cam to her and touched her, saying, ‘ Mistres
    Dee, you are conceived of child, whose name must be Zacharias ; be of good chere, he
    sal do well as this doth ! ’”

    His first wife died on the 16th of March 1575, when “ the Queen’s Majestie, with
    her most honourable Privy Council, and other her Lords and Nobility, came purposely
    to have visited my library : but finding that my wife was within four houres before
    buried out of the house, her Majestie refused to come in; but willed to fetch my glass
    so famous, and to show unto her some of the properties of it, which I did ; her
    Majestie being taken down from her horse by the Earle of Leicester, Master of the Horse,
    at the church wall of Mortlake, did see some of the properties of that glass, to her
    Majestie’s great contentment and delight.” — Compendious Memorial, p. 516. This
    glass is spoken of again.

    This probably gave rise to the anecdote which is related in MS. Ashm. 1788, fol.
    147, viz. that “ he revealed to one Roger Cooke the great secret of the elixar, as he
    called it, of the salt of metalls, the projection whereof was one upon an hundred.”

    Just above this relation some one has written, “ you that rede this underwritten
    assure yourselfe that yt is a shamfull lye, for Talbot neither studied for any such thinge
    nor shewed himselfe dishonest in any thinge.” Dr. Dee has thus commented upon
    it : — “ This is Mr. Talbot or that lerned man, his own writing in my boke, very
    unduely as he cam by it.” There are several other notices of Talbot erased, but
    whether by him or by the Doctor it is impossible to say, but most probably the former.

    This work, although never entirely printed, created much sensation at the time,
    and was the cause of considerable controversy among the politicians as well as literati.
    The Memorial on this subject which Dee presented to the Privy Council has been
    printed by Hearne and others, but it is not generally known that the original
    manuscript of the actual treatise on the correction of the Calendar is still preserved in
    Ashmole’s library, No. 1789, and is the very book which Dee alludes to above. It is
    inscribed “ to the Right Honorable and my singular good Lorde, the Lorde Burghley,
    Lorde Threasorer of Englande,” with the following verses : —
    “ To ὁτι and το διοτι,
    I shew the thing and reason why ;
    At large, in breif, in middle wise,
    I humbly give a playne advise ;
    For want of tyme, the tyme untrew
    Yf I have myst, commaund anew
    Your honor may. So shall you see
    That love of truth doth govern me.”
    The work itself is entitled, “ A playne Discourse and humble Advise for our Gratious
    Queene Elizabeth, her most Excellent Majestie to peruse and consider, as concerning
    the needful Reformation of the Vulgar Kalender for the civile yeres and daies
    accompting, or verifyeng, according to the tyme truely spent.”

    “ Her Majestie being informed by the Right Honourable Earle of Leicester, that
    whereas the same day in the morning he had told me that his Honour and Lord Laskey
    would dine with me within two dayes after, I confessed sincerely unto him that I was
    not able to prepare them a convenient dinner, unless I should presently sell some of my
    plate or some of my pewter for it. Whereupon her Majestie sent unto me very royally
    within one hour after forty angels of gold from Sion, whether her Majestie was now
    come by water from Greenwich.” — Dr. Dee’s Compendious Memoriall, p. 511.

    This refers to the earliest English translation of Euclid by Billingsley, which was
    published in 1570, with a long preface by Dr. Dee. Professor De Morgan is of
    opinion that the translation also was by Dee, or that Billingsley may have been only a
    pupil who worked immediately under his directions. The passage to which Dee
    alludes is as follows: — “ a man to be curstly affrayed of his owne shadow ; yea, so
    much to feare, that if you, being alone nere a certaine glasse, and proffer, with dagger
    or sword, to foyne at the glasse, you shall suddenly be moved to give backe (in maner)
    by reason of an image appearing in the ayre betwene you and the glasse with like
    hand, sword, or dagger, and with like quicknes, foyning at your very eye, likewise as
    you do at the glasse. Straunge this is to heare of, but more mervailous to behold
    then these my wordes cam signifie; and neverthelesse by demonstration opticall the
    order and cause therof is certified; even so, as the effect is consequent.” I refer the
    reader also to Mr. Barlow’s History of Optics in the Encyclopedia Metropolitana.

    There are a great many brief notices in this diary relative to Jane Dee, most of
    which are expressed in astrological symbols ; and as they are exceedingly difficult to
    decipher satisfactorily, and are certainly of very little, if any importance, I have
    thought it expedient to omit them. The entry of “ Ιανε ἁδ θεμ ” is also of frequent
    occurrence, though what “ θεμ ” can refer to I have not been able to discover.
