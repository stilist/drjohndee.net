        Although there <em>is</em> a

        There are

        As in
        {{ "1579-12-09-dee" | post_tag }},
        <q lang=en-Grek-emodeng>οφ ακετελς ονε υππον α υνδρεδ</q>
        is English text roughly transliterated to Greek script. Transliterating
        back to English characters, we get
        <q>of aketels one upon a hundred</q>.
        {{ "Dee, John" | person_tag: "Dee" }} uses
        <q lang=el>κ</q>
        for both
        <q>c</q>
        and
        <q>k</q>,
        so perhaps
        <q>salt of aketels</q>

        <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_acetate>sodium acetate</a>
        or some other acetyl compound.

        is the ambiguous
