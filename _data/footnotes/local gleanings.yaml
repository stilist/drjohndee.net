        Her Majesty
        over two months
        to decide upon giving it to
        Dee.
        Dr. William Chadderton,
        the then Warden of Manchester and Bishop of Chester, had not yet,
        however, actually vacated the wardenship to fill his new
        see of Lincoln, to which
        he
        was elected
        5th April
        (confirmed
        24th May), 1595.
        The license to elect the new bishop
        of Chester
        was
        dated 25th June.
      <p>Wolley
        had long been of
        Dee’s
        acquaintance. The house of
        one Ambrose Wolley
        is mentioned
        in 1549
        in connection with the tithe of
        Mortlake
        (State Papers, Edw. vi., Vol. vi. No. 35).
        In the year 1568
        John Wolley
        was writing very courteous letters on
        Dee’s
        behalf.
        In the following year
        a Mr. Wolley
        is spoken of in a letter to
        Cecil
        as being
        “ well provided, having succeeded
          the late Mr. Ascham ,”
        viz., the celebrated tutor
        (State Papers, Eliz. Vol. xlix. No. 66).
        The office was that of secretary for the Latin tongue to
        the Queen
        (Autob. Tracts, p. 10).
        “ The honorable Mr. Secretary Wolley ”
        was one of the Commissioners appointed
        in 1592
        to hear
        Dee’s
        Compendious Rehearsal,
        he
        then being one of
        her Majesty’s
        Privy Council.
        Sir John Wolley
        21 May 1594
        moved
        Dee’s
        suit to
        her Majesty ;
        and
        she
        granted it, says
        Dee,
        “after a sort; but referred all to

        Kelley's
        successor as
        “ Skryer.”
        He
        is frequently mentioned in the earlier part of
        the Diary,
        as well as subsequently.
        He
        was a native of
        Warwickshire,
        being born
        at Shrugborough
        25 Aug 1554
        (Diary,p.1).
        He
        had become interested in the obscure sciences,and thus had heard of
        Dee,
        to whom
        he
        was introduced
        22 June 1579,
        by
        his uncle Mr. Richard Hickman,
        being commended by
        Mr. Vice Chamberlain Sir Christopher Hatton
        (page 5).
        In 1581
        Dee,
        travelling thro’
        South Mims
        and
        St. Neots,
        came
        to Mr. Hickman’s
        and thence
        to Towcester
        (page 13, and cf p. 50).
        From all this it appears that
        Hickman’s home
        was
        in Northamptonshire.
        Ten years later
        Dee records
        (page 37)
        that
        “ Barthilmew cam up,”
        his daughter Jane
        entering at the same time into
        Dee’s
        service.
        Hickman’s
        visits
        to Mortlak
        were henceforth frequent, and they are entered in
        the Diary
        as if matters of importance hung upon them.
        The last entry in
        the Diary
        about Hickman,
        up to the point where we begin, is on what
        Dee
        calls
        “ the 2nd of our owld December,"
        which
        the Camden Society
        prints
        cold
        December
        (page 51):
        “ Barthilmew
          was preferred by
          me
          to
          the Lord Willoughby his
          servyce
          at Barbican
          in the presence of
          the Countess of Kent :
          and
          the Lord Willoughby
          did presently write
          his
          warrant to
          Mr. Jonson
          in Fletestreet,
          taylor,
          to deliver to
          Barthilmew his
          cloth and couishins, and so it was to
          Barthilmew
          delivered instantly."
        Stowe
        describes
        the manor of Base Court, or Barbican,
        as
        “ lately appertaining to
          Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby of Erseby ”
          (p.113).
        In 1568
        Mr. Richard Bertie,
        writing from
        the Barbican
        to
        Cecil,
        says that having to send to

        it would seem strange if

        He

The Manchester people,and particularly the College-Fellows,began tobe curious about their new Warden ;
        and one of them, Thomas Goodier of Manchester,made this call upon him. The visitor had,however,reasons of his own for thus introducing himself to Dee. Goodier had been,and perhaps was still so,the lessee of the tithes,& c.,of the parish belonging to the Warden and Fellows (Duchy Calendar, iij. 286).
        Thomas Goodyeare married the widow of Ralph Sorocold a rich merchant of Manchester (Stanley Papers,pt.ii.page 143). Goodier and Dee were very soon at variance.

        It is unfortunate that the substance of these letters is not given . Carter,a native of Richmondshire,was a zealous Puritan and known as an able writer against the Roman Catholics. He was the author of An Answere to Certain Popish Questions and Demands, London,
        8vo. 1579, directed against Ritson's Challenge. It was dedicated to Henry Earl ofDerby ;and prefixed was an address to the Reader
        by Anthony Gilby. A copy is in the Chetham Library,the bequest
        ofCanonRaines. Itwas printedbyThomasDawson;butisnot
        mentioned by Ames. Carterwas admitted at St.John's College,
        Cambridge, in 1555 ; was B.A. 1559 ; Fellow of S. John's 18th
        March 1561-2 ; M.A., 1563 ; admitted Senior Fellow 28 April
        1564 ; admitted Preacher 25 April 1565 ; B.D. 1569 ; and he was also bursar and sacrist of his College. About the year 1575 " one
        Mr. Carter, a preacher att Manchester in Lancashire " had a loan of £ 2.from the executors of Robert Nowell's Fund to be repaid 20 March 1575-6 ; and soon afterwards he borrowed £ 2.more “ as by hys byll appeareth.” On 20 Nov. 1576, he received another
        loanof£ 5.beingcalled“OlyverCarterofManchester"(Ath.Cantab. ij.394,554;Notes& Queries,2Siv.130;StanleyPapers,ii. 128 seq; Nowell MS.page 256). Carter's influence with the
        Fellows of the College and with the parishioners of Manchester seems to have been great. His strongest feelings were roused by the scandal of a man,of whom so many strange things were said, taking a place amongst the Fellows. In 15 Eliz.(1572-3) he was engaged in a lawsuit in the Duchy Court about a messuage and land at East Garston in Berks (Cal.iij.4). In 18 Eliz.(1575-6)as a
        Fellow of the College, he prosecuted the then Warden Herle for unpaid wages (Ibid. 41). William Lord Burghley, writing from Greenwich to Bishop Chadderton of Chester, 12 Sept. 1581, speaks of conferring with Mr. Carter about leases of the Warden of Manchester(Peck'sDesid.Cur.4to.i.108-9). In32Eliz.(1589-90) Carter,inrightof Richard Ascrofte,hisbrotherinlaw,lesseeofthe Warden and Fellows of Manchester College,was plaintiff in an action in which John Chetham and Henry Slade were defendants, the matter in dispute being the tithes of corn and grain in Moston Hamell and Blakeley Hamell (Cal. iij. 237). The same year he himself was prosecuted in the same court with three other preachers (Thomas Williamson Preacher and Vicar of Eccles, John Buckley Preacher,and Robert Leighe),by Thomas Goodyeare of Manchester as Lessee of the Warden and Fellows of the foundation of King Philip and Queen Mary ; the action having relation to the dismes and tithes,of whatever kind or quality,Easter-Books,offerings,mortuaries, Chryson pence,and other profits belonging to the College,Church,
        and Chapels (Ibid. 286). Canon Raines states that in this action Carter seems to have established his claim against Goodyeare ( Stanley Papers, ii. 130). During this time Carter had been one of the Moderators ofthe Monthly Lecture inManchester,-a position which gave him great weight in the neighbourhood. Hearing of Dee's
        appointment he was,as we see by the entry in the diary, soon on the alert. Dee had met his counterpart before (viz., 24 Oct.
        1593) in “ Mr. Gray, the Lady Cumberland's preacher," whose “wrangling and despising alchimicall philosophers” he notes in
        thediary. WhenDeecametoknowCarterpersonallyhewouldbe confirmed in a surmise that his character contained few elements of

        This Manchester Survey, which would be a valuable addition to our local topography,is not now known to be in existence. The earliest existing plan of the town is dated about 53 years later.
        Mr. Saxton finally left Manchester on the 14th.
      <p>
        Christopher Saxton,who on the 15th June had been invited by
        Warden Dee to Manchester, and who arrived on 21st June, and came again on 5th July, to make a survey of the town, is too
        ingenious a character to be passed by without observation. He was a
        native of Wakefield, and the author of the first maps of Britain from
        actual survey. The series of maps was nine years in preparation, andwasfirstissuedasacompleteatlasofmapsin1579. Thecopy
        in the Chetham Library was once Sir Christopher Hatton's,whose signature it bears. The maps of Cheshire,Lancashire,and York
        shire were engraved in 1577,which is the earliest date found upon the series,and the date when most of them were engraved. Thoresby
        remarked that the maps had never been surpassed,scarcely equalled,
        for exactness (Loidis and Elmete, Ed. 1816, p. 240). Each map
        contains the arms of the Queen,who gave Saxton a patent for
        publishing the charts for ten years,and of Thomas Sackford, Master of Requests, in whose employment Saxton was at the date of the
        patent. Saxton was also encouraged by Sir William Cordel, Master of the Rolls. His skill as a chorographer is set forth in his epitaph. Thoresby says that in all probability he was buried in Batley Church. Dunningley,the place of his residence,was in the West Riding of Yorkshire, in the parish of W. Ardsley, 3 miles N.E. of Dewsbury, and the same distance east of Batley. Mr. Harland (Cont. Court Leet,p.87)could notfindit. ItappearsinSaxton's map underthe orthographyof“Dunnyngley." Thoresby(Ducat.Leod.,p.195), under Armley parish,describes a monument of Danish times,viz.: “ Tinglaw, as it is in the best map that was ever made for this
        county," which map was “performed by Mr. Christopher Saxton, who lived at or very near that place.”

        quite as necessary to the magistrates as The Office of Justices of the Peace. Mr. Hopwood's choice of literature was , moreover, not
        peculiar where there was a strong local belief in witchcraft,and when the personalty of the devil was a matter of faith. John Wier (born 1515,died24Feb.1588)wasanativeoftheDuchyofBrabant. He
        studied under the celebrated Cornelius Agrippa,and became an able physician. His name is kept in remembrance from the fact that he
        was the first who ,shocked at the barbarous treatment to which prac titioners in witchcraft were treated,attacked the vulgar belief in that illusion. The full title of his work was De Præstigiis Dæmonum et incantationibus ac ueneficiis,and was first published at Basle in 1566, 8vo ; again at the same place in 1583,4to,a copy of which is in the Chetham Library. A French Svo edition was edited by James Grévin in 1579,said to be more complete than the Paris edition of 1567 and 1569,8vo. In the Amsterdam edition of the Opera Omnia, 4to,1660,which I possess,this work.occupies about 600 pages,in six books , dealing respectively with the illusions of devils, notorious sorcerers,witches,the bewitched,the cure ofthe bewitched,and the punishment of sorcerers and witches. The monks attacked the book and its author with great bitterness. Wier contended that those accused of witchcraft were persons whose brains were distempered by melancholy,leading them to believe that they had dealings with the devil,and that they were therefore more deserving of pity than of punishment. Many unsound views and fabulous statements are met with in his arguments ; but these errors, as Mr. Crossley has justly remarked (Potts'Discoverie,pp.x.xi.),“do not the lessentitle him to take his place in the first rank of Humanity's honoured pro fessors, the true philanthropists and noble benefactors of mankind." (Cf. Scott's Demonology and Witchcraft,ed.1831,pp. 184-5)

        Dee,a topographer and arithmetician of the first order,could never have been guilty of all the nonsense which is attributed to him by the transcript of the above entry printed in the Camden Society's edition of the Diary. The perambulation is there given in the follow ing manner :—
      <blockquote><q>
        May 4th, I, with Sir Robert Barber, curat, and Robert Talsley,clerk of Manchester parish church,with diverse of the town of divers ages,went in perambulation to the bownds of Manchester parish : beginning at the Leeless Bench against Prestwich parish,and so had a vew of the thre corne staks,and then down tyll Mr. Standysh new enclosure on the Low,wher we stayed and vewed the stak yet standing in the bank of the dich,being from the corne a eleven measures of Mr. Standleys stak then in his hand,and two fote more,which still I did measure afterward, and it did conteyn in Kentish feete 6 ynches and thre quarters. The survey geometricall of the very circuits of Manchester parish was ended in this,being the sixth day of
        my w o r k .”
      </q></blockquote>
      <p>
        The impression left on the mind in reading this passage is that Deeisdealingwithstacksofcorn. ThreeofthemsubdioinMay
        are scarcely to be conceived of in this climate. Another stack “ standing in the bank of a ditch,” at a distance from the aforesaid
        “ corn," is equally perplexing. A stack in Mr. Standley's hand, containing so many “ Kentish feet,"must have astonished the sober
        men of the town ! Then Warden Dee is inade to work six days at
        the geometrical survey,when he is said two days earlier to have been otherwise engaged .
      <p>
        By his will in 1593 John Buckley, Fellow of the College, be queathed to Mr. Robert Barber, “ one of the ministers of the said College,”his large Geneva Bible in English ; and Barber was one of the appraisers of Buckley's Library,
      <p>
        This is the only contemporary picture that we have about the perambulations of Old Manchester. The ancient custom was in Dee's time in pretty general use. It commonly took place during
        the Rogation Days,and was designed to supplicate a blessing on
        “ the kindly fruits of the earth so as in due time we may enjoy
        them ,” and to preserve or establish an exact knowledge of the limits of parishes. There is an interesting account of one of these peram bulations led by the judicious Richard Hooker, when parson at Boscombe in Wiltshire,in Walton's life of that divine. A homily
        was prepared for the religious service,in which the Psalm “ Benedic, anima mea” was said or sung,and the malediction was pronounced, “ Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's land mark !” The
        Rogation Days in 1597 were the 2nd,3rd,and 4th of May,and on the last of these days, viz.,the Wednesday before Holy Thursday (or
        Ascension Day),the Warden gathered the parishioners of Manches ter to perform this useful service,“ persuading all," like Hooker about
        the very same time, “ both rich and poor, if they desired the pre servation of love and their parish-rights and liberties,to accompany
        himinhisperambulation;andmostdidso." InDee'sDiaryforthe
        year 1596 there is nothing about beating the bounds of the parish on
        the 17th to 19th May,which were the Rogation Days ;but there are
        gaps in the entries about that date ; and his disputes with the Fellows
        may have interfered with a perambulation. The matter was of im portance to Dee, on account of hisquarrels with the landowners
        as to tithes from estates which were on the confines of the parish.
      <p>
        InCanon Raines'MSS.intheChethamLibrary(vol.xxxij.p.9),
        thereisaveryfineholograph letter,foliosize,fromDr.Dee,bearing upon thisveryperambulation of1597. The document,which isinevery way characteristic of the writer, imparts a singular interest to the entry in the Diary, and indeed helps in the transcription of it. The letter is addressed to Mr. William Langley, Rector of Prestwich
        (from 1569 till 1611),who was the associate of Oliver Carter and other Puritan ministers of the neighbourhood,and who was com mended by William Hinde as “that holy man of God,and faithful servantofChristintheHouse ofGod”(LifeofJohnBruen,p.111). Cf. 11 Sept. 1600. It is evident from the memoranda upon the letter that the Parson of Prestwich looked upon the “ homely ” request
        as a very formidable matter, portending litigation with a neighbour to be dreaded.
      <blockquote><q>

        (Endorsed in a modern hand.) Mr. Dee Warden of Manchester
        to Mr. Langley Rector of Prestwich abt ye Boundaries on
        Theile Moor, 1597.
      <p>
        The " extents" of the parish quoted on p. 395 of Mamcestre do
        not help to identify Dee's landmarks. The passage in question puzzled Mr. Hariand (and no wonder),but he passed this "Leeless Bench " without a note (Continuation of Court-Leet Records, Chetham
        Society,vol.Ixv.p.87). The “ Leeless Birch ”passed out of notice
        trees,which enter into with the decay of the tree. These graceful name
        the nomenclature of Birkdale,Birchley,Birchen Bowers,gave a (Birch or Birches)to one of the hamels or hamlets of Manchester
        . The waste is variously.written Thelmore, Theylmore, Theilmoor, & c. The name occasionally occurs in the Manchester Registers ; 6.g., on 26 Aug. 1585, was
        parish,and to other places in the same neighbourhood land over which Dee went in perambulation
        buried Peter Cooke,of Thealmore ; and there was also Theyl-hill (vulgo,th'equal). Dee writes the word somewhat indistinctly,and he might have meant Thelow (i.l., Theyl-low). The growing
        importance of Manchester led to the reclaiming of the wastes around
        it; but it is somewhat extraordinary that the name Thelmore has died out,so far as its use by the inhabitants upon itis concerned. It is now difficult, even with extraneous help,to identifythe landmarks.
        A clue to the discovery of the whereabouts of Thelmore was derived
        from Dee's entry on 3 Sept., 1596,which concerned the boundary between Failsworth Common and Newton Heath,on which occasion DeetriedtomakeanagreementwithSirJohnByron. Whatremains
        ofThelmore may now be seen on the six-inch ordnance map,in The White Moss,between the parish of Manchester and that of Prestwich
        c u m -O l d h a m ; b u t n o n e o f t h e o t h e r o l d n a m e s a l o n g t h e b o u n d a r y a r e recorded
        upon it. The lineofdemarcationwas amatterofcontention
        forseveral years. James Asheton ofChadderton,Esq.,the farmer of
        thetithesofPrestwich,was indisputewiththeCollegeofManchesterin
        the year 1600, and he was also at variance with James Chetham of Nuthurst,gentleman,who drewuptheboundariesfortheecclesiastical
        commission which Dr. Dee mentions under date of 11th September in that year. There are several letters relating to the dispute, as affecting private individuals,amongst Canon Raines's original letters; and,as affecting the rights of the Warden and the College,I have copies of the commissions,interrogatories, and depositions,all of which are full of interesting matter,bearing not only upon the history oftheFoundation,butalsouponthe inhabitantsandthetopography of this obscure quarter. One of the inquiries was prosecuted at Nuthurst,ontheedgeofthewasteaffected,4Nov.,1599. Amongst the witnesses was Randle Kemp of Newton, husbandman, who,
        19July,1600,borrowedofDeeHollinshed'sGreatChronicle. Kemp deposed that the greater part of Theylemore did lye in the parrishe of Manchester,and a lessor part in the parish of Ouldam ; that he knew a brook called Mossbrooke and one little gutter or Ryndle
        running into it in this manner : from Theylmore Mosse into the Meyrelache [i.e.,boundary water),thence betwixt certain ground of one John Cowper ofthe parish of Ouldam,and ofJames Chetam of Nuthurst,gent.;thatheknew ahouseandparceloflandinthetenure ofWydowe Cleaton,improvedoutofThelmoore,on theeastsideof a place called the Meyrelach,which land was in Ouldam parsh,where its tithes belonged ; that he knew another enclosed piece of ground on the south-west side of Meyrelach, in the occupation of Robert Ogden,which was in Manchester parish,and tithes were paid to the Warden ; that " he knew certen stakes or Rydges of moss standing vppon Theylenioore before the same stakes and Rydges were defaced, the which were meyres leading from the said Meyrelache or dytche alongaftertheskirtsofTheylehill(latelycalledtheEquall vntothe
        endofWhytgate,andfromthence neeretoadytcheatthe sydeofa Close of William Tatton's Esquire, lately improved out of Theyle

The weh dytche goeth alonge from the said howse following the sayd dytche vnto the top of Whyttmosse vntil it come to a stake called Corner stake wch is a meyre betwixt the Parishes of Manchester, Prestwich,and Oldham,and so from the

        and from the sayd pytts to one Tree called Leeless birch, being now or late nott far distant from the sayd pytts, and being a meyre
        betwixt the p'isshes of Manchester and Prestwiche.” — (Exchequer Depositions,Record Office.)
      <p>
        On the word “ stake”the following note,from Instructions how to hold a Court-baron,may be cited : “ If any man hath removed any bounds or marks,meare stones or stakes,between this lordship and
        any other, or between tenant and tenant, you must present their names,for it is an evil office and they deserve to be punished for it.” (Manchester Court Leet,p.60 ; and cf. p.50.)

        was usual,gave no satisfaction to the parish. It is interesting to know that the preacher “gotten from Cambridge," was William Bourne,who had been admitted Fellow of St. John's College,C a m b r i d g e , 1 1 A p ., 1 5 9 5 , b e i n g t h e n d e s c r i b e d a s o f S t a f f o r d s h i r e b i r t h . About the end of the same year,he and a majority of the Puritan Fellows of St. John's,amongst whom were William Crashaw and Abdias Ashton,signed a letter to Lord Burghley on the choice of a new master,in succession to William Whitaker. Bourne was then being complained of for nonconformity. Under date of 14 Dec., 1595,itissaidofhim byhisopponents:“Mr.Bournewaschosen thelastelectionfromanothercolledge. Thismanwenttomylord of Lincolne [Chadderton),that was then byshoppe of Chester,to take orders,which he could not have,because he refused to sub scribe. And he was likewise at my lord ofPeterborough (Dr. Richard Howland ), and then repelled for the same cause,and at length he went into Wales to the byshoppe of St. Asaph [Dr. William Hughes]." (Heywood and Wright's University Transactions,vol.ij., pp.67 seq.) Hollinworth says that he was sent down to Manches ter by Drs. Chadderton and Whitaker at the request of the parishioners ; but Chadderton's action in the matter is very unlikely. From theabsenceofhisname inDee'sDiary,itisprobablethat he came hither a few years after Whitacre's death. Upon Bourne devolved the sole spiritual charge of the large parish, and his stipend was paid (not from the college revenue,but) by the inhabitants. See more on this subject under the year 1602-3.

        Raphael Holinshed is said to have been at Cophurst, in the township of Sutton,near Macclesfield. His great book on British history was founded on the collections of Reynold Wolf the printer, and of Leland,and was firstpublished in 1577,fol.2 vols. Dee's edition was probably that of 1586-7, containing additions by John Hooker,Stow ,and others. Shakespeare took some of his plots from
        the first edition. Prefixed to the book is a very entertaining account of the manners and customs of the English in the xvijth century.

        The frequent mention of Newton,or associations with it,in this Diary (cf. 20 April, 1596 ; 18 June, 1596 ; 14 June, 1597 ; 19 July, 1600 ; 19 Jan., 1601),seems to point to something more than mere manerial connection,viz.,to Dee's residence there. Dee occasionally terms the college his " lodging.” The residence of the Wardens in Deansgate,Manchester,was not provided until the middle of the 17th century. As lord of the manor of Newton ,residence there was in part incumbent on the Warden. His house would be that known astheWarden'shouse,nearthesiteoftheoldchapel. TheWarden's close,perhaps the land of the entry of 28 Jan.,1598,occurs in the Cathedral leases 1680-1754,and near itwas the Priestfields.

        Arthur Dee
        has good claims to be considered a Manchester Worthy. According to
        a MS. in the Ashmole collection,
        he
        was born at
        4h. 25m, a.m., on 13 July 1579
        ☉ [solis] ortu.
        In a small 4to MS.
        in
        his
        own hand in
        the British Museum
        (Sloane, 1902),
        Arthur
        gives
        his father’s
        opinion on
        his
        horoscope as follows:
        Magna bona cummultismalis.
        ♐︎ [sagittarius] in domo
        ☉is [solis] significant quod mors nati erit subita: aut occidetur

        ☉♐︎ [sagittarius] in 2 dissipat patrimonium, ad egestatem reducit
          impedimenta et pericula minatur extra patriam, a seruis vulnera.
        In his fourth year
        Arthur
        accompanied
        his
        parents to
        Eastern Europe.
        In 1587,
        while
        at Mortlake,
        Dr. Dee
        attempted to make
        him
        the successor of
        Kelly
        as
        “ skryer ;"
        and
        the boy
        was duly initiated with a solemn ceremony, which is described at length
        in
        the Relation.
        The attempt failed, and
        the father’s
        good sense pursued it no further.
        The boy
        was a scholar of
        Westminster School,
        but
        his name
        has been omitted from the list of the Alumni.
        He
        entered
        there,
        as is recorded in
        the Diary,
        in 1592,
        aged 13.
        The school
        was under
        Camden, the celebrated antiquary and herald,
        and
        Mr. Grant.
        Dee
        and
        Camden
        were already acquainted with each other.
        Dee
        copied for
        him
        one of the inscriptions
        at Manchester
        in memory of a Roman centurion ; and
        Camden,
        in
        his Britannia,
        refers to the service thus,
        “ Mihi descripsit qui vidit Cl. Mathematicus
        I. Dee
        Collegij Mancestrensis Custos”
        (ed. 1607, p. 611).
        To
        Camden,
        Dr. Dee
        sending up
        his son,
        wrote in
        his
        worst hand the following commendatory letter, now printed for the first
        time from
        the Cottonian MS. (Julius C. V. fo. 45),
        which, it seems, is the authority for
        à Wood’s
        remark, that
        the youth
        was of exceeding great and haughty mind, and naturally ready to revenge
        rashly. It forms a curious illustration of school-boy life of the time :—

        On
        his father’s
        removal
        to Manchester,
        Arthur Dee
        was
        seventeen years of age.
        He
        duly entered
        at Christ Church, or St. Mary Hall, Oxford ;
        but
        he
        is said to have left
        the University
        (without a degree) to practise physic
        in London,
        where
        he
        manifested a tendency to empiricism.
        “From London
        (which
        he
        found uneasy to
        him)
        he
        went
        to Manchester in Lancashire,
        when
        his father
        then or lately was Warden of
        the College there,
        and settling in
        that place
        for a time
        he
        took to wife
        Isabella
        dau. of
        Edw [Edmund] Prestwych
        living
        at Holme [now Hulme] near to
        the same town”
        (Athen. Oxon. iij. 287,
        from the information of
        Arthur’s son Rowland).
        These statements want dating. The entries in
        the Diary
        shew that
        Arthur Dee
        was back
        in Manchester
        in 1600 and 1601,
        residing with
        his father,
        waiting for something to
        “ turn up .”
        A year or two later
        he
        married
        Isabella Prestwich,
        of Hulme Hall,
        one of the numerous children of
        Edmund Prestwich, Esq.,
        who died
        in 1598.
        She
        was baptized
        at the Old Church, Manchester,
        22 May, 1583.
        The baptisms of four of
        her
        own children are entered in
        the Manchester Registers,
        the dates of their births being recorded in
        MS. Sloane, 1902,
        in
        the British Museum :—
      <blockquote>
        <p>

          the father being called
          “Arthur Dee, Gent."
          She
          married
          Abraham Ash
          of London,
          merchant, and died
          21 Jan. 1638.

          Doctor in physicke;"
          buried at
          the same place
          (Coll. Ch.)
          23 Sept. 1621,
          the father being again described on the last entry.
          His
          name does not appear in
          the Sloane MSS.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In July, 1607,
        one of the subjects that
        Dr. John Dee
        had in view to consult the spirits was what
        his son Arthur
        should do
        “ to
        his
        help and comfort in
        his
        intended travel.” It is probable that
        Arthur Dee’s
        medical diploma was obtained on
        the continent.
        As is seen by the above entries,
        he
        was recognised as a doctor of physic
        in 1620.
        “At length,” continues
        Wood,
        still without dates,
        “the Emperor of Russia
        desiring
        King James I. of England,
        to send
        him
        one of
        his
        physicians,
        he
        forthwith nominated
        our author, A. Dee,
        as a very fit person. So that soon after obtaining letters of
        commendation,
        he
        went into
        that country,
        where
        he
        continued physician to
        the said Emperor
        14 years or more.”
        The Ashmole MS.
        says
        18 years.
      <p>
        The only royal letter of introduction to be found in
        the State papers is one
        in 1627,
        supposed to belong to
        May of that year.
        is the draft of a letter to be signed by
        Charles I.,
        who recommends
        Dr. Dee,
        Capt. Gilbert,
        John Scrope,
        and others, to
        the Emperor of Russia,
        viz.,
        Michael III., the first Czar,
        who reigned
        1613 to 1645 ;
        and they are to have
        the King’s
        leave to serve
        that Emperor.
        On 11 June,1627,
        Secretary Coke,
        writing from
        Whitehall
        to
        Secretary Conway,
        forwards a letter to
        the Emperor of Russia
        to be sent by
        Dr. Dee
        or
        his
        agent ; if not returned
        by Wednesday noon [13th]
        neither
        the Doctor
        nor
        his
        letters can have passage
        this year.
        He
        also adds that
        George Verney
        wanted a letter under
        the King’s
        hand to
        the Emperor of Russia
        on behalf of
        John Scrope,
        to testify that
        he
        was of noblefamily. Writing again
        on the 13th,
        the same correspondent
        says, that
        the Emperor’s
        letter ran great danger of losing the opportunity of passage by the
        ships then ready to sail. These particulars supply the required dates,
        and enable us to fix a pretty lengthened period for
        Dee’s
        abode
        in Manchester,
        where
        his mother
        died
        23 March, 1604-5,
        the year of the plague.
        Allowing for
        eighteen years’
        sojourn
        in Russia,
        the time for
        his
        return would be
        1645, in which year
        we find that
        Czar Michael
        died.
      <p>
        From an early period
        Dee
        had been captivated by the studies of
        his father,
        and retained
        his
        delight in them to
        his
        latter days. While
        at Moscow,
        he
        wrote
        in 1629,
        a work thus entitled :—
      <p>

        There is
        another edition,
        without date or place of printing, in
        the Bodleian Library.
        In 1650
        it was translated by
        Elias Ashmole.
      <p>
        Mrs. Dee
        died
        in Russia
        6 July, 1634
        (Sloane MS. fo. 11),
        after bearing to
        her husband
        seven sons and five daughters, who settled in different parts
        of Europe.
      <p>
        “On
        Dee’s
        return
        to England,”
        says
        the same MS. authority,
        from the relation of
        Rowland Dee,
        “ he
        was sworn Physician in Ordinary to
        King Charles the first.
        Afterwards
        he
        went to dwell
        at Norwich & there
        dyed
        about the year 1650 [September 1651]
        & lyes buried
        in St George’s Church at Norwich.
        His son Roland
        lived
        8 years
        with
        his father
        in Russia.”
        Sir Thomas Browne
        in 1674
        spoke of
        Dr.A. Dee
        as
        his
        old acquaintance, and gave
        Ashmole
        some memoranda about both
        father
        and
        son
        which were included in
        à Wood’s
        notice of the Dees. In strong affirmations
        the son
        assured
        the philosopher of Norwich
        of
        his father’s
        integrity and claims.

        Rowland Dee,
        called after
        his grandfather,
        was born
        early in 1583,
        and was now therefore
        between seventeen and eighteen years
        of age. At
        the age of eight
        he
        had a narrow escape from drowning, having fallen over head and ears
        in the Thames at Mortlake.
        The above entry shews that
        his father
        had put
        him
        into
        the Grammar School,
        in the administration of which, the Wardens, according to the trust
        deed, were in many ways concerned.
        Dee’s
        visit
        on the 5th August anteà
        was an official visit. One of the regulations was that a roll of names
        should be kept,and
        every third year
        be delivered to the Warden for the selection of those who were to have
        exhibition to
        Oxford
        or
        Cambridge.
        Rowland
        was probably of
        Brasenose College ;
        but of
        his
        subsequent history
        I
        have met with no trace.
