    Just above this relation some one has written, “ you that rede this underwritten
    assure yourselfe that yt is a shamfull lye, for Talbot neither studied for any such thinge
    nor shewed himselfe dishonest in any thinge.” Dr. Dee has thus commented upon
    it : — “ This is Mr. Talbot or that lerned man, his own writing in my boke, very
    unduely as he cam by it.” There are several other notices of Talbot erased, but
    whether by him or by the Doctor it is impossible to say, but most probably the former.

    This work, although never entirely printed, created much sensation at the time,
    and was the cause of considerable controversy among the politicians as well as literati.
    The Memorial on this subject which Dee presented to the Privy Council has been
    printed by Hearne and others, but it is not generally known that the original
    manuscript of the actual treatise on the correction of the Calendar is still preserved in
    Ashmole’s library, No. 1789, and is the very book which Dee alludes to above. It is
    inscribed “ to the Right Honorable and my singular good Lorde, the Lorde Burghley,
    Lorde Threasorer of Englande,” with the following verses : —
    “ To ὁτι and το διοτι,
    I shew the thing and reason why ;
    At large, in breif, in middle wise,
    I humbly give a playne advise ;
    For want of tyme, the tyme untrew
    Yf I have myst, commaund anew
    Your honor may. So shall you see
    That love of truth doth govern me.”
    The work itself is entitled, “ A playne Discourse and humble Advise for our Gratious
    Queene Elizabeth, her most Excellent Majestie to peruse and consider, as concerning
    the needful Reformation of the Vulgar Kalender for the civile yeres and daies
    accompting, or verifyeng, according to the tyme truely spent.”

    “ The year of our Lorde God 1583, the laste daye of Aprill, the Duke or Prince
    of Vascos in Polonia, came to London and was lodged Winchester Howse.” — MS.
    Douce, 363, fol. 125. This account differs from Dee’s by a single day.

    “ Her Majestie being informed by the Right Honourable Earle of Leicester, that
    whereas the same day in the morning he had told me that his Honour and Lord Laskey
    would dine with me within two dayes after, I confessed sincerely unto him that I was
    not able to prepare them a convenient dinner, unless I should presently sell some of my
    plate or some of my pewter for it. Whereupon her Majestie sent unto me very royally
    within one hour after forty angels of gold from Sion, whether her Majestie was now
    come by water from Greenwich.” — Dr. Dee’s Compendious Memoriall, p. 511.

    This refers to the earliest English translation of Euclid by Billingsley, which was
    published in 1570, with a long preface by Dr. Dee. Professor De Morgan is of
    opinion that the translation also was by Dee, or that Billingsley may have been only a
    pupil who worked immediately under his directions. The passage to which Dee
    alludes is as follows: — “ a man to be curstly affrayed of his owne shadow ; yea, so
    much to feare, that if you, being alone nere a certaine glasse, and proffer, with dagger
    or sword, to foyne at the glasse, you shall suddenly be moved to give backe (in maner)
    by reason of an image appearing in the ayre betwene you and the glasse with like
    hand, sword, or dagger, and with like quicknes, foyning at your very eye, likewise as
    you do at the glasse. Straunge this is to heare of, but more mervailous to behold
    then these my wordes cam signifie; and neverthelesse by demonstration opticall the
    order and cause therof is certified; even so, as the effect is consequent.” I refer the
    reader also to Mr. Barlow’s History of Optics in the Encyclopedia Metropolitana.

    very favourably received by her Majesty.

    There are a great many brief notices in this diary relative to Jane Dee, most of
    which are expressed in astrological symbols ; and as they are exceedingly difficult to
    decipher satisfactorily, and are certainly of very little, if any importance, I have
    thought it expedient to omit them. The entry of “ Ιανε ἁδ θεμ ” is also of frequent
    occurrence, though what “ θεμ ” can refer to I have not been able to discover.

    Dee has preserved several interesting notices of his intimacies with the principal
    navigators of his time. A general reference to Hackluyt will be sufficient.

    This entry is not very clear. It either refers perhaps to Harriot, the celebrated
    mathematician, or to the London goldsmith whom the Abbotsford novelist has
    immortalized.

    This notice is particularly interesting, showing the intimate connexion which
    existed between the first English mathematician of the day and the philosopher of
    Mortlake.

    In a note by Dee in MS. Ashm. 488, he says, “ All Barthilmew’s reports of sight
    and hering spirituall wer burnt; a copy of the first part, which was afterward fownd,
    was burnt before me and my wife.”
