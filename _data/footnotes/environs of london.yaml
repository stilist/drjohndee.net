      <blockquote><p>
        In the most ancient record which I have seen relating to this parish,
        its name is spelt Chieham; it has since been varied to Ceiham, Chayham,
        and Cheyham, and has now, for
        <time datetime=P200Y>about two centuries past</time>,
        been uniformly written Cheam. As there is no word in the Saxon language
        nearly similar to the first syllable of the ancient appellation, I
        suppose it to have been a proper name; Ham is well known to mean a
        dwelling.
