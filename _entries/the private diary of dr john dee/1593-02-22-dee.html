a sharp anger betwene me and the Bishop of Leightyn in the towr, for that he wold not shew his farder interest to Nangle: he sayd that after I had seen his brode seal of commendation, that I had institution and induction to the Nangle. Then I sayd his lordship did fable. He there uppon that so moved that he called me spitefully “coniver.” I told him that he did lye in so saying, and that I wold try on the fleysh of him, or by a bastaned gown of him, if he wer not prisoner in the Towr. Inter 44 12ª et 2ª a meridie my sharp anger with the Bishop of Leightyn in the lieftenante’s dyning parlor before the Lieutenant Sir Michael Blunt. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Liewtenat Nant and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Blunt are wittnesses.
