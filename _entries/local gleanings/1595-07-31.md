The Cowntess of Warwik did this evening thank her Matie in my name and for me
for her gift of the Wardenship of Manchester. She toke it gratiously : and was
sorry that it was so far from hens : but that some better thing neer hand shall
be ffound for me ; and, if opportunitie of tyme wold serve, her Matie wold
speak with me herself, &c. I had a bill made by Mr. Wood, one of the Clerks of
the Signet, for the first fruits forgiving given me: Camden Soc. by her Matie.
