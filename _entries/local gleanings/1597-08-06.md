This night I had the vision and shew of many bokes in my dreame, and among the
rest was one great volume thik in large quarto, new printed, on the first page
whereof as a title in great letters was printed Notus in Judæa Devs. Many other
bokes methowght I saw new printed, of very strange arguments. I lent Mr Edmund
Hopwood of Hopwood my Malleus Maleficarum to use tyll new yere’s tyde next, a
short thik old boke with two clasps, printed anno 1517. (Cf. 24 Nov 1582.)
