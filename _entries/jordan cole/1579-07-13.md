Arthurus Dee nātus puer māne hōra quārta trīgintā minūta ferē , vel potius
minūta vīgintī quīnque , in ipſō ortū ſōlis , ut exīſtimō.

I’d say Arthur Dee was born at 04:30, or perhaps 04:25; just at sunrise, I
think. At 10 PM my wife’s farther, Mr Fromond, fell speechless, and died the
next morning (July 14th) at 4 AM.
