  Arthurus Dee nātus puer māne hōra quārta trīgintā minūta ferē , vel potius
  minūta vīgintī quīnque , in ipſō ortū ſōlis , ut exīſtimō .

  I’d say Arthur Dee was born at 04:30, or perhaps 04:25; just at sunrise, I
  think. At 10 <abbr>PM</abbr> my wife’s farther, <abbr>Mr</abbr> Fromond,
  fell speechless, and died the next morning (July 14th) at 4 <abbr>AM</abbr>.
