## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Manage DNS using Namecheap Terraform module
- Use CloudFront's managed cache and origin-request policies
- Split Terraform code into multiple files
- Add Lambda@Edge function to apply security headers -- note this code almost works, but fails with `Update the IAM policy to add permission: lambda:EnableReplication* for resource: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:<account id>:function:inject-headers:7 and try again.` and I give up on chasing obscure errors
- Add debug CSS/JS
- Add tag pages
- Add and update metadata on some entries
- Add and enhance content for 1583 from 'A True and Faithful Relation' (scrying sessions are still absent)

### Changed
- Upgrade Terraform `aws` provider
- Move Terraform code from `terraform/aws` to `terraform`

## [1.0.10] - 2021-03-21
### Added
- Add `dates_for_source`, `hash_keys`, `sort_hash`, and `sorted_people_keys` Liquid filters
- Add `Person` class to centralize functionality
- Link all people and sources from home page
- Note how many times each person appears in entries (based on `people` key)
- Link relevant dates on source pages
- Begin adding biography for John Dee from Charlotte Fell Smith‚Äôs book ‚ÄòJohn Dee‚Äô
- Add some `people` data
- Continue adding entries and letters
- Tag people, places, and source material in lots of entries
- Adjust `people_avatar` include and `Person#name_initials` to handle `people` keys that don't have a corresponding data file
- Display places, sources, and tags on date pages
- Add information for several sources

### Changed
- Refactor `people` include into `people_avatars` and `person_avatar` includes
- Redefine `person_initials` and `person_name` Liquid filters to use `Person` class
- Rename `attribute_from_record` Liquid filter to `attribute_from_object_or_source_record`
- Refactor `mla_citation` Liquid filter to use `attribute_from_object_or_source_record`
- Wrap source material in `<blockquote>` tag, to consistently indicate quoted text
- Convert additional properties from physical to logical: `margin`, `padding`, `height`, `width`, `bottom`, `top`
- Update styling to follow vertical rhythm
- Change `transcludes.html` to not use Markdown
- Change `transcludes.html` structured-data structure to match `entry.html`
- Rename `_lib/collections.rb` to `_lib/data_collection.rb` to match its module name
- Move ‚ÄòAutobiographical Tracts‚Äô information from ‚Äòcommentary‚Äô data to ‚Äòcontext‚Äô, which is more appropriate
- Change Jekyll cache directory to `_cache.nosync`
- Rewrite `HistoricalDiary::SourceMaterialGenerator` to use Jekyll‚Äôs cache system -- `jekyll build` now takes me between 16 seconds and 18 seconds instead of between 23 seconds and 25 seconds if the cache is primed (22%-31% faster), and the code is clearer
- `HistoricalDiary::SourceMaterialGenerator` now understands filenames with comma-separated dates (for example, `_source_material/the private diary of dr john dee/1564-03-01,1593-03-01.md` will appear on both 1564-03-01 and 1593-03-01)
- `HistoricalDiary::SourceMaterialGenerator` now extracts `places` and `sources` from source material, in addition to `people` and `tags`
- Update `theme_color` setting
- `Person` class strips `unknown -- ` from person keys

### Fixed
- Improve structure of person and source pages
- Fix CSS selector for highlighted person avatar
- Adjust `DataCollection#data_collection_record` to handle the case that the `collection_name` collection doesn't have a match for `key`
- Adjust `HistoricalDiary::ManipulateDataGenerator` to handle case that source doesn't have an `editions` hash

### Removed
- Remove `get_author_key` Liquid filter -- its function is better done with the `attribute_from_object_or_source_record` filter

## [1.0.9] - 2021-03-13
### Added

- Add `attribute_from_record` Liquid filter to automatically resolve volumes, editions, etc.

- Tag some additional people and add data
- Display person's full name and title on person page
- Copy tags from source material to `DayPage`

- Display day name on date page

### Fixed
- Correctly tag `lang` attribute on source material
- Handle case that ‚Äòsource‚Äô data file is empty

### Added
- Letter from John Dee to William Langley on 1597-05-02

### Changed

- Adjust ‚Äòmissing content‚Äô text to encourage contributions with a link to edit the file, and a link to the source
- Display ‚ÄòContext‚Äô section on year page rather than date page -- in the future it would be ideal to have a concept of ‚Äòrelevance‚Äô, so a given item of commentary or context is considered relevant to a specific date (or set of dates), or to a year, and only shown in that context
- Use more robust lookup for `author_key` on date page
- Use short day number on date page, rather than 0-padded
- Sort keys in `transclude` `include`, to get more 'ibid's

### Fixed
- Filter out duplicate related dates
- Handle case that no publication information is available in the `mla_citation` Liquid filter
- Fix bugs that prevented `author_key` and `recipient_key` from being passed to the `people` `include`

## [1.0.7] - 2021-02-28
### Added
- Set `class` and `data-key` attributes on ‚ÄòIbid.‚Äô citations
- Annotations for 1582-03-11 entry

- Add letter from John Dee to King James on 1604-06-05

### Changed
- Generation `destination` is now `_site.nosync` -- `.nosync` prevents iCloud from syncing files
- Render commentary markup before related dates & footnotes
- Use shorter titles for year & date pages
- Use `-` instead of `¬∑` in page title, to improve screenreader experience
- Adjust date display in date page header

### Fixed
- Safari 14 doesn‚Äôt support the [`inset-inline-start` CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset-inline-start) -- use `left` by default, and switch to `inset-inline-start` when available. Note that this means the layout is *not* fully RTL-compatible in Safari unless `right` rules are added to compensate for reversed layout.
- Person page and source page now use `<h2>` and `<h3>` for proper hierarchy (reported by Bing)
- Fix bug with logic for removing entry author from list of related people

## [1.0.6] - 2021-02-26
### Added
- Handle source material that has a `footnotes:` array in the front matter
- Add `.terraform/` to Jekyll ignore list
- `mla_citation` Liquid filter now prefers information from a specified volume, falling back to the edition, and finally to the work

- Add stylized SVG rendering of illustrations from 1582-03-10 entries
- Add widget to display the list of people related to an entry

- Add `person_initials` Liquid filter that generates a string of graphemes representing the initials of a name
- Add `person_reference` Liquid filter
- Add `data_record_tag_attributes` Liquid filter that provides a consistent class name and `data-key` attribute so everything using the `person_reference` and `person_link` filters be connected
- Add styling for `<em>` and `<strong>`
- Add JavaScript to display all `person_link` and `person_reference`s that point to the same record

### Changed

- Split 1582-03-10‚Äôs two sessions into separate files
- Refactor `person_link` Liquid filter to use `data_record_tag_attributes`
- `annotate_content` Liquid filter now uses a Yaml file that matches the source material‚Äôs filename -- annotation files apply to at most one entry for a date, rather than all
- Use `data_record_tag_attributes` Liquid filter in `people` include
- Improve CSS for `person-avatar`s

### Fixed
- Code that called the `mla_citation` Liquid filter on date pages was using the incorrect variables for edition and volume
- `annotate_content` Liquid filter now calls `#clone` on content to avoid mutating content that will render on multiple days
- In `HistoricalDiary::DataPage`, handle case that fetched record is `nil`
- Fix layout of `<sup>` footnote references
- Fix ordering of color declarations in CSS
- Fix crashes in `DataCollection` methods when given an object that‚Äôs not a string
- Layout is now entirely RTL-compatible
- Fix spelling of ‚ÄòLundrumguffa‚Äô
- Extend `header` grid area by one column to fix collapsed column between primary and secondary content

- Make an `entry.html` include file with the contents of the date page‚Äôs `<li>` loop

### Fixed
- Change footer links to `LICENSE` and `CONTRIBUTING` pages to use uppercase filenames

### Added
- Generate a calendar page for each year, with a design based on the design of Apple‚Äôs Calendar app in macOS Big Sur
- Add `lifespan_years` Liquid filter that returns an array of the years a given `person` was alive, if both the birth and death year are known

- Set `has_source_material` property for `HistoricalDiary::DayPage`
- Add CSS for the `prefers-contrast: more` media query

### Changed
- Rework CSS so all variables are grouped, and rules use aliases for colors instead of referencing them directly, making it easier to maintain the dark-mode variant

### Fixed

- Improve font loading

### Fixed
- `transclusions_for_timestamp` can now return transclusions for multiple dates, improving the `commentary_for_date`, `context_for_date`, and `relevant_footnotes` Liquid filters
- Put page title back in `<title>` --- was broken as part of removing the `jekyll-seo-tag` plugin

## [1.0.2] - 2021-02-06
### Added
- Set `license` property where possible

- Link to DOI if available

### Changed
- Manually render page metadata instead of using `jekyll-seo-tag` plugin -- the plugin doesn‚Äôt have a way to disable JSON-LD output, but, that output is a secondary, lower-quality version of the structured data applied throughout the site
- Directly host EB Garamond font files -- CSS and files were assembled using the [`google-webfonts-helper` tool](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts/eb-garamond?subsets=greek,latin,latin-ext)
