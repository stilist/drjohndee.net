# The life and times of Dr John Dee

This project is inspired by [Phil Gyford](https://www.gyford.com)’s [The Diary of Samuel Pepys](https://www.pepysdiary.com), though I’ve made some different choices: in particular, I’ve chosen licenses and a project structure that emphasize making this accessible to as many people as possible.

The website and its data are [available via git](https://github.com/stilist/john-dee), and provided under strong open licenses. (See [`LICENSE.md`](LICENSE.md) for details.) The content uses open standards — source material is Unicode text with no markup, and the website makes heavy use of [structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data), which is built on [schema.org](https://schema.org) definitions.

## How to run this project on your own machine

This project is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). You’ll need to have [a supported version of Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) installed.

```shell
# install Jekyll and dependencies
bundle install

# run Jekyll server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

[The Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) has more information.
