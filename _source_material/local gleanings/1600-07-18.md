They cam… It is to be noted of the great pacifications unexpected of man, which
happened this Friday ; for in the forenone (betwene nine and ten) where the
fellows were greatly in doubt of my heavy displeasure, by reason of their
manifold misusing of themselves against me, I did with all lenity interteyn
them, and shewed the most part of the things that I had browght to pass at
London for the College good, and told Mr. Carter (going away) that I must speak
with him alone. Robert Leghe and Charles Legh were by. Secondly, the great sute
betwene Redich men [not Redishmer] and me was stayed and by Mr. Richard Holland
his wisdom. Thirdly, the organs uppon condition was admitted. And fowrthly, Mr.
Williamson’s resignation granted for a preacher to be gotten from Cambridge.
