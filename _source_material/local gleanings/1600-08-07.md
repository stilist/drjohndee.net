I dreamed that a long betwene Algat and the postern on tower Hill did men stand
in a lane with pikes in theyr hands, as though more shold come to them or that
they wayted for some body : but theyr regard and loking was directly to ye
towre where certeyn great personages dyd stand : and one of them as upon a
stage did declare with a loud voyce to the pikemen matter of importance very
lowd and comesth[?] &c.
