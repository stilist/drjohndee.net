Barthilmew went and Crockar. [Repeated thusâ€¯:] John Crockar (my good servant)
had leave to go to see his parents. He went with Barthilmew Hickman and Robert
Charles toward Braibroke, with Arthur Golding, to cure of his fistula. John
Crocker intended to return about Easter or at Whitsuntide next. God be his
God spede. Mr. Humphrey Damport made our steward.
