Being Fryday I rid to Royton (7 myles from Manchester) to Syr John Byron knight
for a quietnes. [Repeated thus :] I rode to Syr John Byron’s to Royton : to talk
with him abowt the controversy betwene the Colledg and his tenants &c. He
pretended that we have part of Faylesworth Common within our Newton Heath,
which cannot be proved I am sure. We wer agreed that James Traves (being his
bayly) and Francis Nutthall, his servant for him, shold with me understand all
circumstances, and so duely to procede, &c.
