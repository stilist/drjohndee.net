Be it remembred,
That this Supplication being exhibited unto her Majestie by the
honourable Countess of Warwick the 9th of November, and read
by her Majestie’s selfe ; thereupon her Majestie immediately
appointed the honourable Mr. Secretary Wolley, and Sir Thomas
Gorge, Knight, Gentleman of her Majestie’s Wardrobe, to be the
two Commissioners, according to the tenor of this Supplication.
And so, the foresaid two honourable Commissioners came the
22nd day of November, A. 1592, to my house at Mortlake, to
see, heare, and perceive some things, according to the intent of the
former Supplication. To whome being set at one table in the
midle of my late library-roome, and next before them two other
great tables, being covered ; the one, with very many letters and
recordes of fifty years course, and testimonies of my studious lyfe,
in and from the most famous places and parties of all
Christendome ; and the other with such divers books of my making,
printed and unprinted, as I had in my foresaid tyme written or
devised : then I did begin my declaration, concurring orderly with
the text of this booke, purposely and by the Commissioners’ advise,
in some order of method most briefely and speedely contrived
against this day.
