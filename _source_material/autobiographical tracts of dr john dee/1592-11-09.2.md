Most gracious Quene,
Forasmuch as the intollerable extremitie of the injuries and
indignities, which your most excellent Majesties faithfull and dutifull
servant, John Dee, hath for some yeares last past endured, and
still endureth, is so great and manifold, as cannot in briefe be unto
your Majestie expressed, neither without good proof and
testimonie have credit with your Majestie : and because also, without
speedy and good redress therein performed, it is to be doubted, that
great and incredible inconveniences and griefes may ensue thereof
in sundry sorte ; (which yet may easily be prevented) your
Majesties foresaid most humble and most zealously faithfull servant
beseecheth your Majestie, to assign two or mo meete and worthy
persons, nobly and vertuously minded, who may and will
charitably, indifferently, advisedly, and exactly see, heare, and perceive,
at the house of your Majestie’s said servant in Mortlake, what just
and needeful occasion he hath thus to make most humble
supplicacion unto your Majestie : and so of things their seene, heard, and
perceived, to make true and full report and description unto your
Majestie. And thus your Majestie’s foresaid most dutifull servant
beseecheth the Almighty God most mercifully, prosperously, and
allwaies to bless and preserve your most excellent Majestie royal.
Amen.
