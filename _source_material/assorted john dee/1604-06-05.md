To the Kings moſt excellent maieſtie.

In moſt humble and lamentable manner beſeecheth your Royall Maieſtie , your Highneſſe moſt diſtreſſed Seruant,
Iohn Dee : That, as, by the grace and prouidence of the Almightie , you are our King, our earthly Supreame Head,
and Iudge : So it may pleaſe your ſacred Maieſtie , eyther in your own royall preſence and hearing; Or, of the Lordes
of your Maieſties moſt honorable priuie Counſell : Or, of the preſent aſſembled Parlament States, to cauſe your High-
neſſe ſayd Seruant, to be tryed and cleared of that horrible and damnable, and to him, moſt grieuous and dammageable
Sclaunder : generally, and for theſe many yeeres laſt paſt, in this Kingdome rayſed, and continued, by report, and Print,
againſt him : Namely, That he is, or hath bin a Coniurer, or Caller, or Invocator of diuels: Vpon which moſt vngodly, and
falſe report, ſo boldly, conſtantly, and impudently auouched : yea , and vncontrolled , and hitherto vnpuniſhed, for ſo
many yeeres, continuing : ( Albiet, your Maieſties ſaid Suppliant , hath publiſhed in Print , diuers his earneſt Apologies, againſt it ) yet ſome 
impudent and malicious forraine enemie, or Engliſh traytor to the floriſhing State and Honor of this Kingdome, hath in Print (Anno 1592.
7. Ianuarÿ) affirmed your Maieſties ſaid Suppliant , to be the Coniurer belonging to the moſt Honorable Priuie Counſell , of your Maieſties
moſt famous laſt Predeceſſor, (Queene Elizabeth) So that, ſeeing the ſaid abhominable Sclaunder, is become ſo highly haynous, and diſgrace-
full, that it pretendeth great diſcredit, and diſliking to be had, alſo, of the ſaid moſt Honorable Lordes, of your Maieſties priuie Counſell (as
to uſe any Coniurers aduiſe: and your ſaid Suppliant to be the man.) It, therefore, ſeemeth , ( vpon diuers reſpects, ) to be very needeful, due
and ſpeedy Order, to be taken herein : by your Maieſties wiſedome, and Supreme Authoritie : ( by one, of the three foreſaid meanes, or any o-
ther,) to haue your Highneſſe ſaid Suppliant, to be tryed, in the premiſſes : Who offereth himſelfe willingly, to the puniſhment of Death: (yea,
either to be ſtone to death: or to be buried quicke: or to be burned vnmercifully) If by any due, true, and iuſt meanes, the ſaid name of Con-
iurer, or Caller, or Invocator of Diuels, or damned Spirites, can be proued, to haue beene, or to be, duely or iuſtly reported of him, or attributed
vnto him : Yea, (good, and gratious King) If any one, of all the great number, of the very ſtrange and friuolous fables, or hiſtories reported
and told of him (as to haue beene of his doing) were True : as they haue beene told, or reaſonably cauſed any wondring among, or to, the ma-
ny headed Multitude , or to any other , whoſoeuer, els. And, then, your Highneſſe ſaid Suppliant, ( vpon his ſaid Iuſtification, and Clearing,
made herein,) will conceyue great and vndoubted hope, that your Maieſtie will, ſoone after, more willingly, haue Princely regard of redreſſing,
of your Highneſſe ſaid Suppliant his farder griefes, and hinderances ; no longer, of him, poſſibly to be endured : So long, hath his vtter vndo-
ing, by little and little, beene moſt vniuſtly, compaſſed.   The Almightie and moſt mercifull God, alwayes direct, your Maieſties royall heart,
in his wayes of Iuſtice and Mercy, as is to him, moſt acceptable : and make your Maieſtie to be the moſt bleſſed and Triumphant Monarch,
that euer this Brytiſh Empire, enioyed.        Amen.
