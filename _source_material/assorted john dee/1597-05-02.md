Wurſhipfull Mr Langley, these are to certifie you, that the bownds
{of} {t}he Pariſhe of Mancheſter, are now in laying out, and by exact workmanſhip
to be drawn into a plat, or charte : (Vppon diuerſe waighty cauſes)
Therfore, ‹by› for aſmuche as , one parte (or side), of our pariſh, in
Thielmore, doth border vppon ſome parte of your pariſh of
Preſtwyche : my deſire is , that your wurſhip wold requeſt
ſome one, or two, of the auncient of your pariſh, to be allſo
beholders of our bownds notifying, toward your pariſh
in that place :   My neighbors do intend to com͠e on Wenſday
next, in the morning, abowt 9 or 10 of the clok to that part that
is by Goodman Smehurſts howſe : and so toward the birche tree,
that is called the Leeleſs Byrche; and thereabowts , for
a little space ; to begynn the vew of the bownds, and meres
of Mancheſter Pariſh: by the order, of an enioyned work
by the higher powres : for avoyding of vndue encroaching
of any neighborly pariſh, one on the other.   You vnderſtand
me sufficiently well, I dowt not.   Pardon my
boldnes, ſo bluntly to borde you with ſo homely a ſute .
Mancheſter . Maÿ 5 . 1597.

Your wurſhips ſincere
Wellwiller in Chriſte
John Dee⁂
