48. John Chamberlain to Dud. Carleton, attendant on the
Governor of Ostend. We keep at a stay, waiting what time will
bring forth. The Earl of Essex is crazed either in mind or body.
New difficulties daily arise about his commission, about the time of
his abode, his entertainment, and the disposing of offices, and he is so
discontented as sometimes to question whether he will go. Sir Geo.
Carey of Cockington, near Plymouth, is to be Treasurer of Ireland, in
place of Sir Henry Wallop. The rebels of Munster and Connaught
bicker among themselves, and Patrick Condon, a ringleader, is said
to be killed or sore hurt. I heard that Capt. Simmes and his
company were cut to pieces by the enemy, but it was only a private
quarrel in which Simmes miscarried. On Saturday, Sir William
Woodhouse, with four hucksters, laid wait for Sir Robt. Drury,
coming from Tottenham to London, wounded him in three or four
places, and left him for dead, but he is likely to recover ; his man
defending him was slain. On the first alarm at Court, the Council
commanded a private search all over the town to apprehend them,
but two hours after it was countermanded ; some say (probably to
move pity) that Sir Wm. Woodhouse was hurt in the face and hand ;
the match was very uneven, five to two, and they taken on the sudden.
Lady Drury, Sir Robert’s mother, is dead, leaving Sir John Scott
a fresh widower. Sir William Woodhouse has not married Lady
Southwell, as was said. Doctor Ledsam, sometime the Queen’s
chaplain, always a giddy-brained fellow, has committed suicide.
Young Norris is to marry Lady Bridget, second daughter of the Earl
of Oxford. We hear fresh reports of Don Sebastian ; that Venice has
sent ambassadors to Spain about him, and that some great men have
been executed in Portugal, and many others removed into Spain,
about this business. I enclose three or four “ toyes.” The letter of
Squier’s conspiracy is well written, but that of Dr. Dee is ridiculous.
The Silkworm is thought to be Dr. Muffetts, and is no bad piece of
poetry. The treatise of Henry IV. is well written ; the author is a
young man of Cambridge, a lawyer. There is much talk about it,
why such a story should come out now, and exception is taken to
the Latin epistle, dedicated to the Earl of Essex. I can find no harm
in it, but it was commanded to be cut out of the book. Private affairs.
