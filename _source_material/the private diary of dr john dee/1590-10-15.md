This afternoone and all the night following
a great storme of wynde at North-West. One Prychard that had
marryed Proctor Lewes his widdow, demaunded £24 of me uppon
an obligation of £64 : whereof by the very note on the bak of the
same £48 is payd, so that £16 only remayne and not £24, as he
unduely demanded : which £16 I challenged for the costes of his
sonne John, three yeres and longer being with me in Mortlak,
and having also his lerning free. Notwithstanding my wife afraid
payd a pownd or two to Mr. Lewys of that £16, and yet Prichard
will go to law.
