Afternone somwhat, Mr. Ed. Keley his lamp overthrow, the
spirit of wyne long spent to nere, and the glas being not stayed
with buks abowt it, as it was wont to be ; and the same glas so
flitting on one side, the spirit was spilled out, and burnt all that

French for som by spirituall could not ; Rowlaschy his thrid boke
of waters philosophicall ; the boke called Angelicum Opus, all in
pictures of the work from the beginning to the end ; the copy of
the man of Badwise Conclusions for the Transmution of metalls ;
and 40 leaves in 4°, intitled, Extractiones Dunstani, which he
himself extracted and noted out of Dunstan his boke, and the very
boke of Dunstan was but cast on the bed hard by from the table.
