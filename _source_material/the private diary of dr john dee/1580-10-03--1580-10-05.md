On Munday, at 11 of the clok before none, I
delivered my two rolls of the Quene’s Majesties title unto herself in
the garden at Richemond, who appointed after dynner to heare
furder of the matter. Therfore betwene one and two afternone,
I was sent for into her highnes Pryvy Chamber, where the
Lord Threasurer allso was, who, having the matter slightly
then in consultation, did seme to dowt much that I had or
could make the argument probable for her highnes’ title so as I
pretended. Wheruppon I was to declare to his honor more
playnely, and at his leyser, what I had sayd and could say therin,
which I did on Tuesday and Wensday following, at his chamber,
where he used me very honorably on his behalf.
