I had
on the Sunday abowt 7 of the clok afternone the cramp most
extremely in the very centre of the calves of both my legs, and in
the place where I had the suddeyn grief on Bartilmew-even last I
had payn so intollerable as yf the vaynes or artheries wold have
broken by extreme stretching, or how els I cannot tell. The payn
42 lasted abowt half a quarter of an howr. I toke my purgation of
six grayns. I began in the morning to drink the drink for the
stone in the kydney.
