The old reckoning betwene me and Edmond Hilton
made clere. Of his eleven pownds demanded, I shewd him of
my old note that he had receyved £6. 15s., and after that Sted his
25s., and Mr. Emery his £3 lent him ; as I did shew him Sted
his letter, and Mr. Emery his letter of the last month. All these
sommes make just an eleven pownd. Payd to nurse Stubble, in
part of payment of her wagis, 5s.
