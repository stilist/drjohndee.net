My dream of being naked, and my skyn all overwrowght
with work like some kinde of tuft mockado, with crosses blew
and red; and on my left arme, abowt the arme, in a wreath, this
word I red — sine me nihil potestis facere : and another the same
night of Mr. Secretary Walsingham, Mr. Candish, and myself.
