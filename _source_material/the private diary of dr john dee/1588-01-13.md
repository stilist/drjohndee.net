At dynner tyme Mr. Edward Kelly sent his
brother, Mr. Th. K. to me with these words, “ My brother sayth that
you study so much, and therfor, seeing it is to late to go to day to
Cromlaw, he wisheth you to come to pass the tyme with him at
play.” I went after dynner and playd, he and I against Mr. F.
Gore and Mr. Rob tyll supper tyme, in his dynyng rome : and
after supper he cam and the others, and we playd there two or
three howres, and frendely departed. This was then after the
great and wonderful unkindnes used toward me in taking my
man.
