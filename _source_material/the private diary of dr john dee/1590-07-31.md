I gave Mr. Richard Candish the
copy of Paracelsus twelve lettres, written in French with my own
hand ; and he promised me, before my wife, never to disclose to
any that he hath it ; and that yf he dye before me he will restore it
agayn to me ; but if I dy befor him, that he shall deliver it to one
of my sonnes, most fit among them to have it. Theoddor had a
sore fall on his mowth at mid-day.
