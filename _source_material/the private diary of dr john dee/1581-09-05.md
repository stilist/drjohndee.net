Roger Cook, who had byn with me from his 14
yeres of age till 28, of a melancholik nature, pycking and devising
occasions of just cause to depart on the suddayn, abowt 4 of the
clok in the afternone requested of me lycense to depart,
wheruppon rose whott words between us ; and he, imagining with
hisself that he had the 12 of July deserved my great displeasure and
finding himself barred from vew of my philosophicall dealing
with Mr. Henrik, thowght that he was utterly recest from intended
goodnes toward him. Notwithstanding Roger Cook his
unseamely dealing, I promised him, yf he used himself toward me
now in his absens, one hundred pounds* as sone as of my own
clene hability I myght spare so much ; and moreover, if he used
himself well in lif toward God and the world, I promised him
some pretty alchimicall experiments, whereuppon he might
honestly live.
