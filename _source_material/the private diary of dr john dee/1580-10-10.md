The Quene’s Majestie, to my great
cumfort (hora quinta), cam with her trayn from the court and at
my dore graciously calling me to her, on horsbak, exhorted me
briefly to take my mother’s death patiently, and withall told me
that the Lord Threasorer had gretly commended my doings for her
title, which he had to examyn, which title in two rolls he had
browght home two howrs before ; she remembred allso how at my
wive’s death it was her fortune likewise to call uppon me.* At 4
of the clok in the morning my mother Jane Dee dyed at Mortlak ;
she made a godly ende : God be praysed therfore! She was 77
yere old.
