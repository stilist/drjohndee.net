monthes ; she was mery and well till the night before ; I helped
to finde the dead birthe within one howr after I had caused her to
have myrh given unto her in wyne warmed, the quarter of a ounce ;
better after she was discharged of the secondyne, and all at ones.
The woman was sufficiently strong after.
