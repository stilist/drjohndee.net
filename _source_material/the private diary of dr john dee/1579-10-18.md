Mr. Adrian Gilbert and John Davys reconcyled
themselves to me, and disclosed some of Emery his most unhonest,
hypocriticall, and devilish dealings and devises agaynst me and
other, and likewise of that errant strompet her abominable wordes
and dedes; and John Davis sayd that he might curse the tyme
that ever he knew Emery, and so much followed his wicked
cownsayle and advyse. So just is Godâ€¯!
