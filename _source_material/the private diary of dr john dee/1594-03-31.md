A great
fit of the stone in my left kydney : all day I could do but three or
four drops of water, but I drunk a draught of white wyne and
salet oyle, and after that, crabs’ eys in powder with the bone in
the carp’s head, and abowt four of the clok I did eat tosted cake
buttered, and with suger and nutmeg on it, and drunk two great
draughts of ale with it ; and I voyded within an howr much water,
and a stone as big as an Alexander seed. God be thanked ! Five
shillings to Robert Webb, part of his wagis.
