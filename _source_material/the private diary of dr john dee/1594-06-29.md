After I had
hard the Archbishop his answers and discourses, and that after he
had byn the last Sonday at Tybald’s with the Quene and Lord
Threasorer, I take myself confounded for all suing or hoping for
anything that was. And so adiew to the court and courting tyll
God direct me otherwise ! The Archbishop gave me a payre of
sufferings to drinke. God be my help as he is my refuge ! Amen.
