Being Fryday, I rode to Syr John Byronâ€™s, to Royton, to talk with
him abowt the controversy betwene the colledg and his tenants.
He pretented that we have part of Faylesworth Common within
our Newton Heath, which cannot be proved I am sure. We wer
agreed that James Traves (being his bayly) and Francis Nutthall,
his servant for him, shold with me understand all circumstances,
and so duely to procede.
