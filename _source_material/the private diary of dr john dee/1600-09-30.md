After
the departing of Mr. Francis Nicols, his dowghter Mistres Mary,
his brother Mr. William, Mr. Wortley, at my returne from
Deansgate, to the ende whereof I browght them on fote, Mr. Roger
Kooke offred and promised his faithfull and diligent care and
help, to the best of his skill and powre, in the processes
chymicall, and that he will rather do so then to be with any in
England ; which his promise the Lord blesse and confirm ! He told
me that Mr. Anthony considered him very liberally and frendely,
but he told him that he had promised me. Then he liked in him
the fidelity of regarding such him promise.
