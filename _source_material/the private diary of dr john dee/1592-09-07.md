Robert Charles of
Northamptonchyre and goodman Warren of Marketharborow in
my howse at Mortlak promised me to help Barthilmew Hikman
with Â£12 to pay on Michelmas Day next to discharge the bond
for his brother-in-law. This they promised uppon condition I
wold be bownd to them to see them repayd agayn. I sent a letter
to Sir Robert Thaneth to Rushmer by Ypswych by the
wagonman who is at ynn at the George in Lombard Streete. He sayd
that Robert Thaneth was at home and well.
