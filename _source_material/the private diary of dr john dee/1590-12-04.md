The
Quene’s Majestie called for me at my dore circa 3½ a meridie as
she passed by, and I met her at Estshene gate, where she
graciously, putting down her mask, did say with mery chere, “ I
thank thee, Dee ; there was never promisse made but it was
broken or kept.” I understode her Majesty to mean of the
hundred angels she promised to have sent me this day, as she
yesternight told Mr. Richard Candish.
