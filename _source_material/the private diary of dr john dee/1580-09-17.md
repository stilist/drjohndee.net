The Quene’s Majestie cam from
Rychemond in her coach, the higher way of Mortlak felde, and
whan she cam right against the church she turned down toward
my howse : and when she was against my garden in the felde she
stode there a good while, and than cam ynto the street at the
great gate of the felde, where she espyed me at my doore making
obeysains to her Majestie ; she beckend her hand for me ; I cam
to her coach side, she very speedily pulled off her glove and gave
me her hand to kiss ; and to be short, asked me to resort to her
court, and to give her to wete when I cam ther ; hor. 6¼ a meridie.
