Abowt nine of the clok afternone, Michel,
going chilyshly with a sharp stik of eight ynches long and a little
wax candell light on the top of it, did fall uppon the playn bords
in Marie’s chamber, and the sharp point of the stik entred throwgh
the lid of his left ey toward the corner next the nose, and so
persed throwgh, insomuch that great abundance of blud cam out
under the lid, in the very corner of the sayd eye ; the hole on the
owtside is not bygger then a pyn’s hed ; it was anoynted with St.
John’s oyle. The boy slept well. God spede the rest of the cure !
