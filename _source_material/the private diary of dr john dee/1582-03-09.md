Fryday at dynner tyme Mr. Clerkson and
Mr. Talbot* declared a great deale of Barnabas nowghty dealing
toward me, as in telling Mr. Clerkson ill things of me that I
should mak his frend, as that he was wery of me, that I wold so
flatter his frende the lerned man that I wold borow him of him.
But his frend told me, before my wife and Mr. Clerkson, that a
spirituall creature told him that Barnabas had censured both Mr.
Clerkson and me. The injuries which this Barnabas had done
me diverse wayes were very great.
