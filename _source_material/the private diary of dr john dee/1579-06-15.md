My
mother surrendred Mortlak howses and land, and had state geven
in plena curia ad terminum vit√¶, and to me was also the reversion
delivered per virgam, and to my wife Jane by me, and after to my
heirs and assignes for ever, to understand, Mr. Bullok and Mr.
Taylor, surveyor, at Wimbledon, under the tree by the church.
