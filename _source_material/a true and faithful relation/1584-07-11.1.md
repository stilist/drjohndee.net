Wedneſday, Julii 11.   Mane hora, 6 ½.     Cracovie.
Oratione dominica finita, &c.
Δ. We await the promiſe, which you made us , O Gabriel.
A voyce. Not now, but at the fourth hour, declining as before.
E. K. And why not now as well ?
A voyce. He that laboureth in his own harveſt laboureth when he li{f}t : but he that fiſheth on the
Sea, muſt be ruled by her {c}ourſe.
Δ. Fiat voluntas Dei.
