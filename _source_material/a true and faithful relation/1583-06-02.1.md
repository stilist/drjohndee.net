Monday à Meridie hora 4 ½.
Δ. We presented our selves, ready for instruction receiving, and presumed not to call my
good Minister spiritual, but by humble prayer referred all to God his good pleasure.
E K. The Golden Curtain which covereth all the Stone hangeth still,
but I heare a voice or sentence thrice repeated, thus.
A voice. …… Sanctum, Signatum,& ad tempus.
Δ. The sense hereof may be divers wayes understood, and more then I can imagine, but
which sense is to our instruction would I faine know.
A voice. …… Sanctum, quia hoc velle suum; sigillatum quia determinatum ad tempus.
E K. Hard speeches, but he could not perfectly discern them.
A voice …… Ad tempus & ad tempus (inquam) quia rerum consummatio. All things are at hand.
The Seat is prepared.
Justice hath determined.
The Judge is not yet willing.
Mercy thrusteth it self betwixt the Divinity. But it is said,
The Time shall be shortned.
E K. Saw no creature: But the voice came behind him over his head,
till now: when he espied one standing on the Table besides the silke
cloth on which the Stone stood, he seemed like a Husbandman all in red
apparel, red hose close to his legs, a red jacket, red buttoned cap on his head,
yea, and red shooes. He asked E. K. how he did, and E.K. answered,
Well I thank God.
Δ. By your apparel it should seem you have somewhat to say concerning the Commons
of this Realme, and not of high School-points, or Sciences. I am desirous to know who sent
you? What is your message? and what is your name? for a name you  have peculiar as all
Creatures elfe.
Δ. He paused a good while; whereupon I asked him if he considered my speeches?
…… I consider your speeches, for I have left nothing behind.
E. K. He kneeleth down and seemeth to say somewhat, his speech is
quick, round, and ready. He seemeth to pray in a strange Language. I per-
ceived these words among many other, Oh  Gahire Rudna  gephna oh
Gahire, &c.
His Countenance was directed towards the Stone.
…… Vestra a non mea facio.
E K. Now he standeth up.
…… Hast not thou said, From whom comest thou? What is thy message? [Δ. He looked to-
ward me] And hast urged my name? Saying, All things have a name. It is true; for so they
have because they are. Hast thou left any thing unsaid?
Δ. You rehearse my speeches not onely in general, but also in particular.
The will of God be done (to his glory) for the rest.
……… My message is from him, in whose name thou has desired it, which hath said lift up thine
eyes, and look unto (behold I say) the sum of my Commandments, 1. What I am, 2. Whose Mini-
sters you are, and (as it is said before) 3. To what end and purpose it is.
Then cease to plead when Judgement standeth in place; For all things are determined already.
The 7 doores are opened. The 7 Governours have almost ended their Government.
The Earth laboureth as sick, yea sick unto death.
The Waters pour forth weepings, and have not moisture sufficient to quench their own sorrows.
The Aire withereth, for her heat is infected.
The Fire consumeth and is scalded with his own heat.
The B{o}dies above are ready to say, We are weary of our courses.
Nature would fain creep again into the bosom of her good and gracious Master.
Darknesse is now heavy and sinketh down together: She hath builded herself, yea (I say) she hath
advanced herself into a mighty building she saith, Have done, for I am ready to receive my burden.
Hell itself is weary of Earth: For why? The Son of Darknesse cometh now to challenge his
right: and seeing all things prepared and provided, desireth to establish himself a kingdom; say
-ing, We are now stronge enough, Let us now build us a kingdom upon earth, and Now establish
that which we could not confirm above.
and therefore, Behold the end.
When the time cometh, The …… thy sorrows shall be greater than the sweetnesse, the sorrows
(I mean), of that thou seest; I mean in respect of the sweetnesse of thy knowledge. Then will you
lament and weep for those thou thought were just men.
When you earnestly pray it shall be said unto you Labor. When you would take Mercy Justice
shall say, Be it so.
Therefore (I say) thirst not overmuch: For fear least thy capacity be confounded.
Neither move thou him which hath, moved all things already to the end.
But do thou that which is commanded.
Neither prescribe thou any form to God his building.
All things shall be brought into an uniformal Order.
Whom thou sayest that thou hast not yet confirmed, confirm with good counsel. It is said I have
accepted him.
Are not these News sufficient?
It is said, He shall govern me a people: of himself he cannot.  Therefore let him believe, and
secondly Rejoyce that the  Angel of God hath so governed him.   That in Election he shall
govern him a people.
Desireth he to hear of greater blessednesse?
He hath also said: Then shall it be said unto him, O King.
It followeth consequently that he is called, and that to a Kingly Ofice: For whosoever is An-
nointed in the Lord, his Kingdom is for ever.
Will he be the son of perdition? Let him then with his fathers put on the garments of pride.
Desireth he news? Tell him thou has prayed for him; the Devil envyeth him, and his estate.
Tell him that I say so.
Say it is a shame for a Kings Son to commit theft; and for him that is called, to do the workes
of unrighteousnesse. Studiest thou to please him? Give him sharp and wholesome counsel: For in
him (I say) the state and alteration of the whole World shall begin.
Wouldst thou know from whence I came? Thou shalt.
But do it Humbly, it is not my part to meddle any further than my charge.
But as it is said before unto thee, So shall it come to passe.
Moses had a rod whereby he was known, and tbe hand of God approved.
Let him use therefore to carry the rod of righteousnesse about him.
For we are seven: and in us is comprehended that rod wherewith Moses wrought. As it is be
gun so I end: What ye see here is holy [pointing to the …… and by him sealed and for until the time.
Therefore use patience herein until the time that is said unto the ……
Venite, videte, (& loquimini) Judicia mea.
He that saith thus (I speak of myself, and as concerning my message,) is equal with the great
est Angels, and his name is Murifri.
Thou has written my name, and I am of thy Kalender, because thy Kalender is of God.
In the grounds of all thy Tables thou shalt finde my name.
Δ. I remember not any such name written by me, but it maybe contained in some new
Composition, or Collection.
Mur. …… It is true, for if thou hadst remembred all those things which thou hast written, then
should not my message need.
Δ. If I might without offending you, I would move two Petitions unto you, one concerning
the Soul, and the other concerning the body: Concerning the Soul, is for one Isabel Lister,
whom the wicked Enemy hath sore afflicted long with dangerous temptations, and hath
brought her knives to destroy herself withall; she resisteth hitherto, and desireth my helping
counsel, which how small it is God knoweth. The other is of another woman, who hath great
need, and is driven to maintain herself, her husband, and three children by her hand la-
bour, and there is one that by dream is advertised of a place of Treasure hid in a Cellar, which
this woman hath hired thereupon, and hath no longer time of hiring the said Cellar, but till
Midsummer next. She, and this dreaming Maiden digged somewhat, and found certain to-
kens notefied unto her: But so left off. I would gladly have your help herein, if it pleased God.
Mur. …… I answer thee, I will come again soon, and thou shalt receive a Medecine which shall
teach thee to work help in the first. The second is vanity, for it is not so, but to the intent that
after great hope of this world hath infected the weaklings minde: Desperation might have the more
open and ready entrance. But yet she shall be comforted for thy sake.
Δ. The praise be unto God.
Mur. …… I Go.     One thing I have to say, be faithfull in all things.
      I have said.
Δ. I prayed, and gave thanks hartily to God for his mercieds, and graces, and so rose up.
Δ. Then he said write, M.49. under V.43. under R.35. 1. and 47. under /F. R. I.\
This shal lead thee to my name; he that sent me be amongst you. Δ. Amen, Amen, Amen. \9. 33. 42/
Δ. Note in Tabula Collecta, (which I first gathered of the 49. good Angels) I took the third
letters out of the names, it is to wit, out of the 49th. name, and th…… 47. 9 33. 42. which
agreed very well with the letters, but the five and thirtieth name did not yield R. in his third
letter. Therefore I am…… in the……
