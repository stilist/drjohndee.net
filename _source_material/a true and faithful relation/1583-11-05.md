Tueſday Novemb. 5. we came to Buxtenbaden, and there by 9 of the clock in the morning
we took water in two great Skutes or Boates, Horſe-wagon, and our ſtuff and all, and ferryed
down the little water, till we entred the Elb, and ſo croſſed ſtraight over to Blanken naſen :
there dined, and after dinner by coaches we came to Hamburgh, where my Lord lay at the
Engliſh houſe, and we at another lodging, a widows houſe.
