  Thurſdday 17. Octob. We came from Angem to Embden, going without the Iſles , and coming
in at Weſter E{m}b . We came before the Town, by ſix of the Clock after noon : but could not
get in at the Gates, and therefore we lay all night a ſhipboard, but my Lord A. L. went over
to the lodging of the other ſhoar.
