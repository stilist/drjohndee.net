  Δ. Becauſe E. K. came not, ( according as it was bidden yeſterday ) to follow the Acti-
on : I went to his Study door, and knocked for him :  And I requeſted him to come ; and
he refuſed ſo to do, and gave me a ſhort and reſolute anſwer,  That he would never more
have to do with theſe Actions.   I aſked him the reaſon why :  He would give none :  But
earneſtly denied to proceed.   I told himthat his words * yeſternight ( that he could not
this day deale ) did very much grieve me, &c. whereof he made ſmall account.  So I went
into my Study again, and committed the Cauſe to God.
After half an hour and leſſe, he came ſpeedily out of his Study, and brought in his hand
one Volume of Cornelius Agrippa his works , and in one Chapter of that Book he hread the
names of Countries and Provinces collected out of Ptolomeus ( as the Author there noteth )
Whereuppon he inferred, that our ſpiritual Inſtructors were Coſeners to give us a deſcription of
the World, taken out of other Books : and therefore he would have no more to do with them.
I replied, and ſaid, I am very glad that you have a Book of your own, wherein theſe Geogra-
phical names are expreſſed, ſuch as ( for the moſt part ) our Inſtructors had delivered unto
us : and that, according to the Tenor and form of my requeſt to him, ſo to hav{e} them ex-
preſſed : for our more perfect information, by thoſe known names ; to underſtand thoſe 91
unknown and unheard of names, of ſeven letters every one :  whereby they (our Inſtructors I
mean) are very greatly to be thanked, and to be deemed (in all reaſonable mens judgements)
moſt friendly, and far from coſenage, or abuſing of us : And farther I ſaid, that my ſelf, had
here ſet down on a paper, all the 91 names together orderly, as we received them, and thnat
I had here brought the deſcription * Geographical of the whole earthly Globe: and alſo
Pomponius Mela ſet forth in Engliſh with the Chartes thereunto belonging, fairly deſcribed
by hand : To the intent he might ſee the verity of their words yeſterday delivered unto us :
for the performance of my requeſt made to them, on Tueſday  laſt in this form of words, as
the Book hath it recorded thus ;
   Δ. As you gave us a taſte, or warning of Italia and Britania, ſo, if it be thought good
   to you, we are deſirous to underſtand of the reſt ,  the Application to ſuch names as we
   underſtand.
Whereby you may perceive ( ſaid I to E. K. ) how your reaſon is marvellouſly confounded
by your wilful phantaſie :  For ſo much as, wherein you would find fault, in our ſpiritual
Inſtructors doings, Therein they have done that which I requeſted them : as appeareth ; and
that to the intent, of known Countries we might underſtand which Angels had the govern-
ment : for ſuch purpoſes, as occaſion might offer or require our practices to be tryed in.
This ( quoth I ) is to groſſe your error, and to wilful your wrangling :  But I do in nar-
rower points peruſe and conſider their words and doings ; In which though ſometimes my
writings ( after your declaration ) hath been amended by them, yet the occaſion of miſwrit-
ting for the moſt part, hath been either in your miſreporting what you ſaw and heard, or
in my wrong hearing, or writing : and ſometime by the ſpiritual preſent correcting of my
writing, and ſometime longer after, &c.
But for all this, E. K. remained of his wilful intent ; and ſo departed to his Study again :
And I committed God his Cauſe, into his own hands, care and ordering, as may be beſt for his
honour and glory.  So be it.
