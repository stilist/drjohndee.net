  Saturday, Februarii, 1. We paſed the dangerous way of Ice, having 25 men to cut the Ice
for our Coaches to come through above two Engliſh miles long : but for all that great help,
we could not get to Vinew City that night, by reaſon of the great  water  and Ice hard by
the Town, which was broken over the banks into the medows very deep.
