  Emericus went and delivered my Letter to the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour : But this he brought
back again ; ſaying that the Emperour was ridden very early abroad to Brandeiſh, or elſe-
where : (not certainly being known) and that this Noble Octavius Spinola was gone with his
Majeſty.
  Hereupon I determined with changing the Date, to * ſend unto him at
the Emperour his Majeſties returning to Prage.  Deus bene vertat.
