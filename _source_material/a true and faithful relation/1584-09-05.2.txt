                   Wedneſday, September 5.             N O T E.
 Δ. The morning of this Wedneſday (before I prepared myſelf for the former action) I ſent
Emericus with two Letters to be delivered : the one to the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour (giving him
thanks for his honourable dealing with the Emperours Majeſty in my behalf) and the other
to the Noble Octavius Spinola : thanking him likewiſe, and requiring his inſtruction , or adviſe
how I might moſt conveniently proceed in dealing with the Emperours Majeſty : The Copy
of which Letter I thought good to record here, that the effect thereof conſequent, might have
the light of the Original cauſe (Divine and humane) annexed.
