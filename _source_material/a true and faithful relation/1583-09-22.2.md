  This 22. day we were in great danger of periſhing (on the ſands , called the Spits ) about
midnight : We had (by force of winde contrary) anchored by them, and the Anchor came
home, no man perceiving it, till the ſhip was ready to ſtrike on the ſands. Then, upon great
diligence and pollicy uſed by our Marriners in hoyſing ſayl, and cutting our Cable, (to leave
our ſhore anker) and committing our ſelves to the hands of God, and moſt earneſtly praying for
a proſperous winde : It pleaſed the Almighty , and moſt mercifull God , ſuddenly to change the
winds, which ſerved us to bear fro in the ſands, and to recover Quinborrough, back again.
