            Saturday, Septemb. 21.  1583.   Die Sancti Matthæi.
We departed from Mortlack , about three of the Clock after noon : The Lord
Albert Laſky , (Vaywode of Siradiæ, in Polonia) meeting me on the water , as
we had appointed:  And ſo brought night to London ; and in the dead of the night,
by Wherries, we went to Greenwich to my friend Goodman Fern the Pot-
ter his houſe : Where we refreſhed our ſelves, and thither came a great Tylt-
boat from Graves end to take us in, (by appointment of me and Mr. Stanley) to
go to our ſhips , which we had cauſed to ly ſeven , or eight mile beyond Graves
end.
