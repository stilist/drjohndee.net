Wenſday Novemb. 6. we rid to Tritiow 4 mile from Hamburgh, a little Village, having left
my Lord behinde : and alſo miſſing my Children and ſervants , which were gone before us an
other way to my great grief : till by midnight, by ſending out meſſengers to liſten and en-
quire after them, I heard of them. I, my Wife, Rowland, Nurſe, and Myrcopskie, my Lord his
man.
