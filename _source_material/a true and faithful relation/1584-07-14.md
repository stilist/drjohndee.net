  1584.    Remember that on Saturday, the fourteenth day of July, by the Gregorian Calen-
der, and the fourth day of July, by the old Calender, Rowland my Childe (who was born
Anno 1583. Ja{nu}ary 28.  by the old Calender) was extreamly ſick about noon, or midday,
and by one of the Clock ready to give up the Ghoſt, or rather lay for dead, and his eyes ſet
and ſunck into his head, &c.
  I made a vow, if the Lord did foreſee him to be his true ſervant, and ſo would grant him
life, and confirm him his health at this danger, and from this danger I would (duriug my life) on Saturdayes eat but one meal, &c.
