  Note.  In the mean ſpace while I was thus occupied with the foreſaid Mr. Curtz. E.K. was
viſited at our Lodging with a wicked Tempter, who denied any Chriſt to be : and that as the
heart received comfort of all the Members of the body : So that he, who is God, of all things
received comfort by Angels , and other the Members of the world : and that I was now with
one, who would uſe me like a Serpent, with head and tayl compaſſing my confuſion, &c. he
earneſtly reviled E. K. in divers manners: he ſaid, that E.K. ſhould be damned, and ſaid :
moreover, that of our practiſes ſhould never come any fruitfull end, &c.
      Δ. The eternal and Almighty God confound the Adverſaries ofhis truth and glory,
          and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Redeemer, and the Triumphant Conquerour a-
          gainſt, Hell, ſin, and the Devil.  Amen.
