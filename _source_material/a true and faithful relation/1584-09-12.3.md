  Δ. Which anſwer, both by word of mouth, and thus by writing being received by me : and
the said Emericus being (by the Noble Spinola) willed at Evenſong time, to bring my anſwer
herein ; which I gave him of my great good liking the ſame, and moſt humble thanks to his Maje-
ſty, for so wise and gratious his conſideration had of the cauſe. I required the ſame Emericus to
underſtand ; when, and how ſoon Doctor Curtzius should be made privy of his Majeſties plea-
ſure herein : and ſo, after my diſpatching of Emericus, I endeavoured my ſelf to render thanks
unto God for his mercies, graces,and truth, in these his affairs : beſeeching him to frame my
heart, tongue, and hand in ſuch ſort, as to his Divine Majesty, my dutifull ſervice, doing, may
be acceptable : as chiefly of me intended to his honour and glory : And ſecondly to the
comfort of the godly and elect : And thirdly to theconfuſion of the proud, arrogant, ſcorn-
full enemies of truth and vertue. Amen.
