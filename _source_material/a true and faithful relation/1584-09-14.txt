                      Friday, Septemb. 14. Mane, circa 10.
  I ſent Emericus to Doctor Curtz his houſe in parva parte : with my commendations ; and
to ſay that before, I underſtood of Doctor Hageck Mr. Doctor Curtz his deſire to be ac-
quainted with me : whereof I was very glad and desirous : and now I truſt that the Empe-
rour his majeſty, by his Authority hath taken order with him whereby to begin our ac-
quaintance, and ( God willing ) our perpetual friendſhip. The Doctor was at home, and to
Emericus ( ſaying the effect of my meſſage before noted ) the Doctor declared that Captaverat
antea varias occasiones mecum contrahende amicitiæ, &c. and that now he is very joyful of the
occaſion offered by the Emperours Majeſty : and that this day ſundry affairs did hinder the
opportunity of our meeting, but to morrow at any hour ( at my choice ) he would be ready
to welcome me to his houſe : and ſo with the uſual phrase of offering all his ſervices to my
pleaſure, he ſent Emericus to me with his ſaid Anſwer.
                   Quos Deus conjungit, Homo ne ſeparet.   Amen.
            Quos autem Deus & Cæſar copulat, copulatiſſimi maneant.  Amen.
