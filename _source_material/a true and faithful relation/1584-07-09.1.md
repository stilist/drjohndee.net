E. K. As ſoon as he looked, he found the Stone covered with the
white Curtain.
Δ. A pauſe of a ¼ of an hour : In which ſpace I uſed ſundry ejaculations to God, and his
good Angels.

peared not, but uſed a voice.
A voice. …… This day, but the Sun declining the fourth hour.
Δ. Your meaning is, that at afternoon, at 4 of the clock.
The voice. ……As thou haſt written ⸻
Δ. The will of the Higheſt be done.     Amen.
