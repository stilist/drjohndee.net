  # There are two possible 'Brandeish'es near Prague: Brandýs nad Labem-Stará
  # Boleslav, and Brandýs nad Orlicí. The former is 20-25 km away, and the
  # latter is over 150 km. The former seems more likely.

  Emericus went and delivered my Letter to the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour : But this he brought
back again ; ſaying that the Emperour was ridden very early abroad to Brandeiſh, or elſe-
where : (not certainly being known) and that this Noble Octavius Spinola was gone with his
Majeſty.
  Hereupon I determined with changing the Date, to * ſend unto him at
the Emperour his Majeſties returning to Prage.  Deus bene vertat.
