Thursday, Circa 9.
As I was in my upper Study , and had gathered the holy words of the second and third
call, and had conferred them with their Engliſh delivered alſo unto us : E. K.  came up the
ſtairs, and so went into his Study, and came out again, and as he was going down the ſtaires I
opened my Study door , and ſaluted him : He thereupon came up again , and came into
my Study : And there I ſhewed him what I had done ; and how I had some under-
ſtanding of thoſe holy words, their ſignifications by reason of due applying the Engliſh
to the word Chriſtus, intending thereby, to have induced E. K.  to like the better of  the
manner of our friends, due, and Methodical, proceeding with us, and told him that unleſſe
of this ſtrange language I ſhould have theſe words delivered unto us Letter by Letter, we might
erre both in Orthography, and alſo for want of the true pronunciation of the words, and di-
ſtinctions of the points, we might more miſſe the effect expected : But as on Tuſsday last , ſo
now again he ſaid, our Teachers were deluders, and no good, or ſufficient Teachers, who had
not in two years ſpace made us able to underſtand, or do ſomewhat : and that he could in two
years have learned all the ſeven Liberal sciences, if he had firſt learned Logick, &c, where-
fore he would have no more to do with them any manner of way, wiſhed himself in England,
and ſaid that if theſe books were his, that he would out of hand burn them , and that he had
written to my Lord (by Pirmis) that he took our Teachers to be deceivers, and wicked, and
no good Creatures of God, with many such ſpeeches, and reaſons (as he thought) of force
to diſwade himself from any more dealing with them : But willed me to uſe John my Boy as
my Skryer, for that these ſpiritual Creatures were not bound unto him,&c. I anſwered unto
all these parcels and reaſons, as time ſerved declaring my perfect truſt in God, that ſeeing I have
many years deſired , and prayed for wiſdome (ſuch as theſe Actions import) at his hands,
and by ſuch means as to his Divine Majeſty ſeemeth beſt, that he would not either miſlike my
prayer, or abuſe my Conſtant hope in his goodneſſe and mercy : Therefore I concluded that
I referred all to the mercifull will of God, and doubted nothing at the length to be ſatiſ-
fied of my requeſt , and prayer made unto him.   So he went from me this ſecond time. …
God lighten his heart with knowledge of the truth, if it be his Divine will and pleaſure.
Note.  Permis went on laſt Wednesday morning , and had received our Letters after
noon, on Tueſday last : But on Monday before the wicked Prince of darkneſſe did what he
could to hinder our proceeding.
