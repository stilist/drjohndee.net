                  Thurſday, Septembris 13. Manè, hora 7.        † Pragæ.
  I received the Noble Octavius Spinola his anſwer by Emericus, as concerning my accepting of
the Emperour his gratious former anſwer of condeſcending to my requeſt, ſo much as he conveniently
could : which my anſwer yeſterday * night, late was delivered to the Noble Spinola.   Where-
unto he ſaid, that my Anſwer would be moſt acceptable unto the Emperour : and that to morrow,
(meaning this Thurſday ) the honourable Doctor Curtz ſhould underſtand the Emperours
pleaſure herein. Hereupon I willed Emericus to go up to the Caſtle, and to bring himſelf
in ſight of the Noble Spinola, if he could.   Thereby to help his memory, for warning and in-
formation to be given to the ſaid Doctor Curtz : That ſo we might come together, ſo ſoon,
as conveniently might be.
                        Deo, omnis laus, honor, & gloria.    Amen.
