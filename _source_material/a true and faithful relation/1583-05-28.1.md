Δ. As J. and E. K. sate discoursing of the Noble Polonian Albertus
Lasci his great honour here with us obteined, his great good
liking of all States of the people, of them that either see him
or hear of him, and again how much I was beholding to God
that his heart should so fervently favour me, and that he doth
so much strive to suppresse and confound the malice and envie of
my Country-men against me, for my better credit winning
or recovering to do God better service hereafter thereby, &c.
Suddenly, there seemed to come out of my Oratory a Spirituall
creature, like a pretty girle of 7 or 9 yeares of age, attired on
her head with her hair rowled up before, an dhanging down very long behinde, with a gown of
Sey, ……changeable green and red, and with a train she seemed to play up and down………
like, and seemed to go in and out behind my books, lying on heaps, the biggest…………and as
she should ever go between them, the books seemed to give place sufficiently, dis… one heap
from the other, while she passed between them: And so I considered, and ……… the diverse
reports which E. K. made unto me of this pretty maiden, and ……………
Δ. I said …… Whose maiden are you?
Δ. Sh. ……… VVhose man are you?
Δ. I am the servant of God both by my bound duty, and also (I hope) by his Adoption.
A voyce. …… You shall be beaten if you tell.
……… Am not I a fine Maiden? Give me leave to play in your houfe, my Mother told me she
would come and dwell bere.
Δ. She went up and down with most lively gestures of a young girle, playing by her selfe,
and diverse times another spake to her from the corner of my study by a great Perspective-
glasse, but none was seen beside her selfe.
…… Shall I? I will (Now she seemed to answer one in the foresaid Corner of the Study)
…… I pray you let me tarry a little [speaking to one in the foresaid Corner]
Δ. Tell me who you are?
……… I pray you let me play with you a little, and I will tell you who I am.
Δ. In the name of Jesus then tell me.
……… I rejoyce in the name of Jesus, and I am a poor little Maiden, Madini, I am the
last but one of my Mothers children, I have little Baby-children at home.
Δ. Where is your home?
Ma.…I dare not tell you where I dwell, I shall be beaten.
Δ. You shall not be beaten for telling the truth to them that love the truth, to the eter-
nal truth all Creatures must be obedient.
Ma. …… I warrant you I will be obedient. My Sisters say they must all come and dwell with you.
Δ. I desire that they who love God should dwell with me, and I with them.
Ma. …… I love you now you talke of God.
Δ. Your eldest sister her name is Esémeli.
Ma. …… My sister is not so short as you make her.
Δ. O, I cry you mercy, she is to be pronounced Eseméli.
E. K. She smileth, one calls her saying, Come away Maiden.
Ma.……I will read over my Gentlewoemen first.
    My Master Dee will teach me, if I say amisse.
Δ. Read over your Gentlewoemen as it pleaseth you.
Ma. …… I have Gentlemen and Gentlwoemen, Look you here.
E- K. She bringeth a little book out of her pocket,
……… She pointeth to a in Picture the book.
Mad. …… Is not this a pretty man.
Δ. What is his name?
Ma.……My …… saith, his name is Edward, Look you, he hath a Crown upon his head, my Mother
saith, that this man was Duke of York.
E. K. She looketh upon a Picture in the Book with a Coronet in his hand
and a Crown upon his head.
Ma. ……This was a jolly man when he was King of England.
Δ. How long since is it that he was King of England?
Ma. …… Do you ask me such a question, I am but a little Maiden? Lo, here is his Father
Richard Plantagenet, and his Father also.
Δ. How call you him?
Ma. ……Richard, Surely this was Richard Earle of Cambridge.
E. K. She turneth the book leaves, and said.
Mad.……: Here is a grim Lord, He maketh me afraid.
Δ. Why doth he make you afraid?
Ma. …… He is a stern fellow, I do not know him what he is. But this was the Duke of Cla-
rence. This was Father to Richard Earle of Cambridge. Lo, here is Anne his wife.
E. K. Turning over the leafe,
The same was heir to all Mortimers lands.
Edmund was her brother.
Lo, Sir, here be the wicked Mortimers.
E K. She turned over diverse leaves, and then she said
Ma. …… This same is Roger Mortimer.
……My Mother saith this man was Earl of the Marches.
This same is his wife.
He had a great deale of lands by her, for she was an Heire.
This same is wild Genvill, her Father.
Here is a Town they call Webley. Here is Beudley.  Here is Mortimers Clybery.   Here is
wild Wenlock.  Here is Ludlow.  Here is Stanton Lacy.   Genvill his wife was Heire of all
these. Here is Hugh Lacy her Father. He weareth his haire long, for he was Deputy of Ire-
land; That maketh him look with such a writhen face.
My sister hath torne out the other two leaves, I will bring them when you have supped.
I pray do not tell anybody of me.
