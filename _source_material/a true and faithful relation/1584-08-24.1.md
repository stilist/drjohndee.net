Friday, Auguſti, 24. à Meridie.     Pragæ.
Being willed to deal with Rodolphus, firſt by letter, and then by ſpeech :   I thought good
to ſend the Letter before written, for  the Emperour ; by the Noble Don wilhelmo de St.
Clemente, the King of Spain his Præfectus Negotiorum with this Emperour : and thereupon by
Emericus Sunttag, the Lord Laſkie his Secretary, I wrote this to the aforeſaid Don Clemente,
and ſent it this Bartholomew Day.
