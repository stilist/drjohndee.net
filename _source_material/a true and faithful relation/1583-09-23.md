  The 23. day (being Munday) we came to the mouth and entrance of Quinburrough Creek , or
Haven.  And as we made to land in ſmall Fiſher-boats, the Lord Laſkie, my Wife and Chil-
dren in one boat, and I, with E. K. Marie , Elizabeth, and John Crokar , in another, it fell ſo
out, that at the ſhips ſide, our Fiſher-boat his ſayl-yard and ſayl  was entangled on the Mayn-
yard of the Fly-boat (being ſtroke down) ſo that, in our ſetting from the ſhips ſide , the top
of our Boat being faſt above, and the windes and ſtream carrying the Boat off below , it in-
clined ſo much on the one ſide, that the one half of the Fiſher boat (well near) was in the wa-
ter, and the water came ſo in (by the intangling before ſpecified , not eaſily to be undone, or
looſed) that my Lord, my Wife, and all that ſaw us thought that of neceſſity our Boat muſt
ſink, and ſo, we to have periſht. But God in his providence and mercy had greater……of
us, ſo that we became clear; the Boat half full of water, ſo that we ſat wet to the knees , and
the water with the billow of the Sea came ſtill beating in more and more : And in this mean
trouble ; one of our two Boat-men, had loſt his long Oare out of the Boat into the water ; and
ſo not onely we lacked the help of that Oare , but alſo by reaſon they would have followed
the winde and ebb, for that Oar, (contrary to our courſe in hand, and not able to become by )
with much adoe we conſtrained them with the ſayl, our one Oare, and the Rudder to make
ſuch ſhift as they could to get to Quinborrough Town : And in the mean ſpace E.K. with a
great Gantlet did empty moſt part of the water out of the Boat, elſe it muſt needs have ſunk by
all mans reaſon. At length (to be brief) we came to the Town ſide, up the crooked Creek: where,
when as the Maſter of our ſhip would have taken me out in his arms ( ſtanding in the water
with his Boots) he fell with me in the water, where I was foul arrayed in the water and Oaſe.
God be praiſed for ever, that all that great danger was ended with ſo ſmall grief, or hurt.
