Δ. Remember that on Wedſday night, April the 25. my Lord Albert Laſkie came at night
to Cracovia, and lay in a little woodden building, among guards, by St. Steniſlaus Church : and
on the Friday morning following intended to enter his journey toward Keſmark, and the
recovering of Keſmark : Jeſus proſper his juſt Cauſe.
