Sonday,  Aprilis 15.    Mane Hor. 7½.
After a few prayers neceſſary , and invitation to Gabriel and Nalvagé for their inſtru-
ctions.
…… Our inſtructions ſhall grow moſt plentifully amongſt you.   But give place to time, for
this is the voyce of the higheſt.   Be holy and righteous in the works of your hands , and keep al-
wayes the Sabbath of your Redeemer hereafter : For even yet, the Seprent is amongſt us.  For
even yet the Seprent is amongſt my holy ones, and endeavoureth to cut you aſunder.    Therefore
I ſay be holy even in the works of your hands, for he thinketh to prevail againſt you : But let your
houſes be ſwept clean, that when the ſpy entreth, he finde nothing to feed on.
Δ. We ceaſed and gave our ſelves to the Sabbath : conſidering, intending hence foreward
to viſit the Church and Aſſembly, to pray and meditate on God his ſervice.
Solus Jeſus Chriſtus eſt Triamphator contra mortem & Diabolum , Nominus Noſter &
Deus Noſter.    Amen.
