  On Monday and Tueſday the 17th. and 18th. of September, I ſent Emericus up to the Ca-
ſtle, to liſten after anſwer of that Doctor Curtz his report to the Emperour, of that he had
the perceived by me. (But on Monday Octavius Spinola had ſent into the Town for Emericus,
and told him that the Emperour had care and deſire to underſtand my doing with the Doctor:
And therefore aſked Emericus if I had been with the Doctor, and he affirmed that I had.
Hereof (ſaid he) the Emperour will be glad: And yet (as I began to note) Emericus coming
on Tueſday in the face of the Doctor in the Ritters ſtove; had not one word ſpoken to
him, that either he had ſpoken to the Emperour, or he had not. And therefore I ſuſpect that
the Doctor dealeth not honeſtly, faithfully, or wiſely in this ſo weighty a caſe. And foraſ-
much as he told me, that the Emperour his Majeſty was perſwaded, that he waſpious, &c. per-
haps he would be loath; now, to prefer me to the ſpeech of the Emperour, ſeeing both he him-
ſelf, and the reſt of his counſel ſtood perſwaded to the contrary of this King. Hereupon this
great delay, upon ſiniſter report made to the Emperour might follow, &c.
