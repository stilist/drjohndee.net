Monday after supper 1583.
Δ. After supper, as we were together in my study, and attending somewhat the return of
the good messager spiritual, and said that he promised to come again suddenly, he appeared
and answered.
Mur. …… So I am, write 7. 30.25. 44.37.35 46.
To the first S. to the second O. the third L. the fourth G. the fifth A. the sixth R. the 7th. S.
A. That maketh S O L G A R S.
Mur. …… Add the first, and last number together, it maketh 53. let that be the Centre to the rest.
Δ. To be put to the Center of the Steptagonum.
Mur. …… So. The ground hereof is to be found in the third Table in the first book: I mean in
the third of the seven, the Table of B.B. &c. being the first.
My name is also to be found in the same Table.
Form this upon a plate of lead: It prevaileth as a cure against such infections.  My promise
is done.
Δ. How is this to be used?
Mur. …… Use it upon the body molested, adding the letters of her name in a small Circle on the
back half, not the letters in their forms expressed, but the number of such letters.
Δ. We know not how to number her name in our letters.
Mur. …… Take them out of the second Table (any Table else of the Seventh will serve) so that
thou take the numbers as thou findeth them placed with the letters.
Δ. How is this to be used about her body?
Mur. …… As by discretion shall be thought best: It prevaileth sufficiently, so it be done, but thus
far I teach thee, and this, as concerning nature.
The health of him which sent me be amongst you, Amen.
Δ. Gloria & gratiarum actio perennis sit Deo nostro omnipotenti uni & Trino, Amen.
