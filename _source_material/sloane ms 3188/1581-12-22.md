Anno 1581. Decembris 22. Mane.

Δ After my fervent pray[ers?] made to God, for his m[?]f[?]
[?] [?] and inſtruction, the [?] the ministry of his
h[our?] and my [?ur?] Angel, named Anael, ([?] [if?] [?]
his Divine pleasure) I willed, the Skryer (named
Saul) to loke into my great Chryſtaline Globe, yf
God has had sent his holy Angel Aneal, or no:
And Saul loking into my [f?]or[?]s stone, (or Chryſtall Globe)
for to s[pye?] Anael, he [?] there [?]e, [?]i[?] answ[?] to
that name. But being [?]ſt[ur?] [?] of me to tell
the Truthe yf he was Anaël, An other did ap[?]
very bewtifull, with apparill yellow, glittering, like gold. and his
h[ead?] had b[?]s like ſt[a?]r beams, blasing, and spredding from it; his eyes
fyrie. He wrote in the stone very much hebrue in hebrue letters, and the
letters se[a?]med all transparent gold. Which, Saul was not able [?]yther
presently to reade, that I might wri[te?] after his voyc[e?], neyther [t?]o
imitate the letters in short tyme.
A bright st[a?]r, did go vp and and down by him.
There appeared allso a [wh?]ite* dog, with a long h[e?]d.
And many other visions appeared, with this second: the first being [v?]oyd[e?]d
quite away. Therevppon I sayd, as follow[e?]th.
Δ ⸺ In nomine Jesu Christi, quis tu es? — he anſwered to Saul his hearing.
AN. ⸺ Potest[as?] omnis, in me sit[a?] est.
Δ ⸺ qu[?]?
AN ⸺ Bona, et mala.
Δ ⸺ Then appeared in the stone, these two letters M. G.
I then axing him ſom̅e queſtions, de Thoſaur[o?] abſcondito:
he anſwered,
AN ⸺ Ne perturbes: Nam h[æ?] ſ[un?]t Nu[?].
And withall appeared many [dedd?] [mens?] skulls,
on his left hand.
He ſayd to me,
AN. ⸺ Vbi est potestas tua?
Δ ⸺ Cur qu[æ?]ris [?] potestate aliqua mea?
AN. ⸺ Cur? Signifi:, non mihi placet.
Δ ⸺ I, thereuppon, set by him, the stone in the frame:
and sayd.
Δ ⸺ An bo[nus?] aliquis Angelus, assignatus est huic speculo?
AN. ⸺ Etiam.
Δ ⸺ Quis?
AN. ⸺ —‏‎מִי‏כָאֵל—he answered, by the shew of these letters [on my?] ſtone
Δ ⸺ Bo[nus?] ne ille Angelus, de qͦ in scripturus f[or?] mentio?
AN. ⸺ Maximè.
Δ ⸺ Tieri ne potest, qùod ego eundem vid[eam?], et cu̅ illo a[q?]am?
AN. ⸺ Ita. and therewith appeared this character ⸺ A
Δ ⸺ Quid p[e?]r hoc, significare velis ?
AN ⸺ Alterius Angeli character est.
Δ ⸺ Cur hîc, et nunc ostendis?
AN ⸺ Cai[cſ?]am ob magn[u?]m—Make an ende: It ſhalbe declared, but not by me.
Δ ⸺ By whome then ?
AN ⸺ By him that is aſsigned to the stone: but not, tyll after the feast . And then thow
muſt prepare thy ſelf, to prayer and faſting .
In the Name of God, be Secret: and in all thy doings praying, tyll thow haſt thy
desyre : which shall not be far of.
After Newyeres tyde, Deale, But not on the Sabaath day
Pray continually.
When it ſhall pleas god, to stir the vp, Then procede. In the brightest day,
when the Sonne shyneth: In the morning, fasting, begynne to pray .
In the Sonne Set the stone.
Deale both Kneeling, and sitting. I have done for this tyme .
My name is ANNAEL.
I will speak ones more to the : and than fare well: for thow ſhalt not
haue me any more.
Be not hasty in wrath.
Δ ⸺ Is this, that, you ment to speak?
AN. ⸺ I. Do good to all men. God hath ſufficient for the, and for all men.
Fare well.
Δ ⸺ Gloria patri et filio et spiritui sancto. Sicut erat in principio,
et nunc et semper : et in sæcula sæculoru̅
Amen .
Δ ⸺ Remember, that diuerse other particulars, m[o?]wght have byn Noted of this daye[s?]
Action : but these may suffice:. And yet it is not to be forgotten , that
as he sayd his name was Annael (with a dubble n) to be allſo [confeſsed?]
him ſelf to be the same Annaël which is prepos[itu?]s orbis veneris :
and allſo Chief governor Generall of this great period, as I haue
Noted in my boke of Famous and rich Dyscoueries .
