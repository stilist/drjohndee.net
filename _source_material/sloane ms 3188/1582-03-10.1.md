In nomine Jesv CHRISTI. Amen.

Anno 1582. Martÿ die. 10. hora 11¼ Ante meridiem. Saterday.

One M ͬ Edward Talbot *cam to my howſe , and ‸he being willing and deſyrous
to see or shew ſom͠e thing in spirituall practise , wold haue had me to haue
done ſom͠e thing therein . And I truely excuſed my ſelf therein : as not in
the, vulgarly accownted Magik , neyther studied, or exerciſed : But confeſsed
my ſelf, long tyme to haue byn desyrous to haue help in my philosophicall studies
throwgh the Cumpany and information of the blessed Angels of God . And there⹀
vppon , I browght forth to him , my stone in the frame ( which was given me of
a frende ) and I sayd vnto him , that I was credibly informed, that to it
( after a ſort ) were anſwerable Aliqui Angeli bom . And allſo that I was
ones willed by a Skryer , to call for the good Angel Anchor , to appere in that
stone to my owne sight . And therefore I deſyred him , to call him : and (yf
he wold) Anachor and Anilos likewise , accownted good Angels. For I was
not prepared therevnto .  &    He then ſettled him ſelf to the Action : and
on his knees att my deſk ( setting the stone before him ) fell to prayer and
entreaty    &c     In the mean space, I, in my Oratory did pray, and make
motion to god , and his good Creatures for the furdering of this Action .
And within one quarter of an howre (or less ) he had sight of one in the
stone . but he still expected for two more : deeming this to be one of
the three ( namely Anchor Anachor Anilos ) . But I then cam to him ,
to the stone : And after som͠e thanks to God, and wellcome to the good
Creature, vſed ; I required to know his name . And he spake plainly ,
(to the hearing of .E.T.) that his name is VRIEL .
Δ ⸺ Are you one of them (sayd I, Joh͠n Dee) that are anſwerable, (vppon
  due observations performed ) to this stone ?
VRIEL ⸺ I am.
Δ ⸺ Are there any more beſyde you ?
VR ⸺ Michaël and Raphaël . But, Michaël est princeps in operibus nostro{s}
Δ ⸺ ys my boke , of Soyga , of any excellency ?
VR ⸺ Liber ille, erat Ad{æ} in Paradiſo reuelatus , per Angelos Dei bonos .
Δ ⸺ Will you give me any instructions , how I may read thoſe Tables of Soy{ga?}
VR ⸺ I can ⸺ But solus Michaël illius libri est interpretator .
Δ ⸺ I was told , that after I could read that boke , I shold Liue but two
  yeres and a half.
VR ⸺ Thou ſhallt Liue an Hundred and od yeres.
Δ ⸺ What may I, or muſt I do, to haue the sight, and preſence, of
   Michael, that blessed Angel ?
VR ⸺ Præſent{ia}s {.a͠.} postulate et invocate , sinceritate et humilitate
  Et Anchor, Anachor , et Anilos , non ſunt in hunc Lapidem invocandi .
Δ ⸺ Oh, my great and Long deſyre hath byn to be hable to read thoſe Table{s}
  of Soyga .
VR ⸺ H{æ}c maximè reſp{i}ciunt Michaëlem . Michaël est Angelus ,
  qui illuminat {g}re{ssu}s tuos. Et hæc revelantur in virtute et veritate
  non vi .
Δ ⸺ Is there any speciall tyme, or howre to be obſerved, to deale for
   the enioym{y} of Michael ?
VR ⸺ Omnis hora , est hora nobis .
Δ ⸺ After this, there Δappeared in the stone a strange seale, or
   character{iſmus} of this faſhion  enſ{uing} :
Δ ⸺ What is the intent, or vſe of this ?
*VR ⸺ Sigillum hoc in au{r}o sculpendium, ad defenſion͠e corporis, omni
   Loco , tempore et occaſioneſ. et in p{ec}tus gestandum.
Δ ⸺ So we ceaſed , with thanks to god : and I {...}ſt{..} much vppon this
    Action : and layd all vp in mynde, and w{riting} .
                 Δ ⸺ Soli Deo Honor omnis, et gloria.
                                Amen.
