The same Saterday after none . Hora .5.

Δ ⸺ After that M ͬ E.T. had called Vriel , and I was com͠e to the stone
 and had vſed a short speche of thanks giving to God : ‹an› I then required
 some instruction for the purpose of Soyga
VR ⸺ Peace . you muſt vſe Michaël.
Δ ⸺ I know no meanes or order to vſe in the invocat{my} of Michaël
VR ⸺ He is to be invocated by certayn of the pſalmes of Dauid, and
  prayers . The which pſalmes, are nothing els, but a means vnto the
  seat and Maiestie of God : whereby you gather with your ſelues due
  powre; to apply your natures to the holy Angels . I mean the pſalmes ,
  commonly called the Seven pſalmes . You must vſe pleaſant ſa{uou}rs:
  with hand and hart : Whereby you ſhall allure him and wy{nn} him
  ( through Gods fauour ) to atteyn vnto the thing , you have long sowght for.
There must be Con{i..}ction of myndes in prayer, betyxt you two, to
  God contynually.
Yt is the wyll of God , that you ſhold , ioinctly , haue the knowledge
 of his Angells togither
You had atteyned vnto the Sight of Michaël , but for the imperfection
 of Saul.
Be of good Cumfort.
Δ ⸺ The chayre cam into the stone againe : and I axed what
  it ment .
VR.⸺ This is a seat of perfection : from the which , things ſhall be
 ſhewed vnto the , which thou hast long desyred .
Δ ⸺ Then was there a square Table browght into the stone : and I
   demanded, what that Table betokened .
VR ⸺ A Mysterie, not yet to be known . These two, ſhall remayn
in the stone , to the sight of all vndefyled Creatures .
you must vſe a fowre square Table , two cubits square : where vppon
muſt be set Sigillum Dei ‹D{uuni}tatis› , which is allready *perfected in a
boke of thyne :    Blessed be God , in all his Myſteries, and Holy in
all his works.    This seal muſt not be loked on , without great reurence
and deuotion  .  This seale is to be made of perfect wax .  I mean, wax ,
which is clean purified : we haue no respect of cullours.
This seal muſt be 9 ynches in diameter : The rowndness muſt be 27
ynches , and somwhat more . The Thicknes of it, must be of an ynche
and half a quarter . and a figure of a crosse , must be on the back ſide
of it, made thus :

The Table is to be made of swete wood : and to be of two Cubits high .
with 4 feate : with 4 of the former seales vnder the 4 feet.
Δ ⸺ The faſhion of the 4 feet , standing vppon the foreſayd rownd ſeales ,
   was ſhewed : ſo as the vttermost circle conteyning the letters, did ſeme to be
   clean *without the cumpas of the fete , equally rownd about the same fete .
   And these seales were ſhewed {mu}ch lesser than the principall seal .
   Vnder the Table did ſeme to be layd red sylk, two yardes square .
   And ouer the seal, did seme likewise red sylk to lye fowr square : somwhat
   broader then the Table , hanging down with 4 knops or taſsells at the
   4 corners thereof .
Vppon this vppermost red silk, did ſeme to be set the stone with the frame : nigh
  ouer , and vppon the principall seal : ſauing that the sayd sylk was betwene
  the one and the other
The Table was ſhewed to have on the fowre sides of it , *Characters and names
 these, that are in a schedule annexed , in 4 diuerse rowes .
VR ⸺ The characters and words on the sides of the square Table, are to
  be written with yellow , made of perfect oyle , vſed in the church.
Δ ⸺ What oyl is that
VR ⸺ of oyl ſhalbe opened vnto you . The oyle, is perfect prayers :
    of other oyle I haue no respect.
    We sanctifie , bycauſe we are holy : and you sanctify bycauſe of your holines
VR ⸺ There is a spirit, named Lundrumguffa vſing you
    who seketh your deſtruction , in the hatred of men , in the hurt of
    thy goods . Diſcharge him to morrow with Brymstone.
    He harmeth thy howſe , and ſeketh the deſtruction of thy dowghter .
    His pretence was to haue maymed the in thy sholder the last night ,
    and long ago .        Yf thow do not diſcharge him to morrow ,
    he will hurt, both thy wife and thy dowghter.
He is here* now
Giue him a generall dyſcharge from your family and howſe
He will seke Sauls death , who is accurſed.
Δ ⸺ I know no means, or art to do this by . For I did burn in flame
   of Brymſtone, Maherion his name and Character , whan I fownd
   Saul priuilie dealing with him ( which manner of wicked dealing
     I had oft forbydden him ). and yet he cam after, and wold haue
     carryed Saul away quick : as Robert Hilton, George, and other
     of my howſe can teſtify .
VR ⸺ The Curſed, will com͠e to the curſed.
Δ ⸺ I beſeche you to diſcharge him : and to bynde him ſom{ware},
wherefor of, as Raphael did ( for Thobias sake) with the wydke{d}
  spirit Asmodeus
VR ⸺ But Thobias did his part . Art is vayne, in respect {of}
   of God his powre . Brymstone is a mean
Δ ⸺ Whan ſhall I do this ?
VR ⸺ To morrow at the tyme of prayers.
          Δ ⸺ Gloria P{r}ĩ et filio et spiritus sancto
               sicut &c.  Amen.
