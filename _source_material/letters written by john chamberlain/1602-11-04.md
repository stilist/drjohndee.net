LETTER ⅬⅩ.

[Domestic Correspondence, State Paper Office, Nov. 4, 1602.]

SIR,
I have had leysure enough to bethincke myself how and in what
sort to thanсke you for your packet I receved at the closing up
of my last that went by Peter Browne, but the more I thincke the
lesse I am satisfied to see that wordes are but a windie requitall for
somany pretty discourses and presents, and that I have none other
meanes to acknowledge your kindnes, so that you must even put me
in the number of your doubtfull or rather desperate debtors, except
some extrordinarie goode fortune come to cleere me out of your
booke ; and now was I leaving this theme, and falling to other
matters, when your cousen Lytton calles me foorth to receve a
pacquet sent from Mussi your post, three or fowre dayes after his
arrivall, for the which I can adde nothing to that I saide before,
but rather, if it had come sooner, might chaunce have said lesse, for
leves gratiœ loquuntur, ingentes stupent. Now comming so fresh from
reading your letters and discourses of Biron, I cannot go on without
touching a point or two en passant. Let the French twaddle what
they list of his dieng en soldat, I cannot perceve by ought I have
seen or heard but that he died very timerously and childishly, which shewes
that his valour was rather a French furie, then true fortitude. Another
observation came to my remembraunce in reading his proces, of three
straunge disasters befallen three great men,a in three neighbour
countries in three yeares successively (this, you see, passes tres sequuntur
tria), and all theire cases so intricate, specially the two straungers, and
theire persons and services so magnified that a great part of the world
rests unsatisfied in their deaths, and will not be perswaded against
their deserts by any undeservings ; but mundus vult decipi, and so let
it go. I can finde neither rime nor reason in such extraordinarie
usage and entertainment of your Suisse,b being more then they were
fit to receve, and more then beseemed the King to geve to such
muffes ; so that we censure it here either for indiscretion or abjectnes ;
and for the 800,000 crownes yearly (but that you write it) I shold
hardly beleve the King wold buy them so deare. The third part of
that pension being much and more then they are worth. Your
brother and sister Carleton are both in towne about the funerall of
Mr. Marsh, his goode hoste and frend, who died apoplecticall. No
doubte but he will informe you of whatsoever he can come by.
You writ to him of the comming of your boy, of whom as yet
we have no tidings. We heare out of Spaine that ODonell,c riding
toward the Court at Valladolid, died sodainly by the way, and
being opened there was found in him a serpent(as some call it),
or rather a worme, with two heades, of eight foote longe. Matters
begin again untowardly in Mounster, where one Cormach Mac Teaghe
(or, as some terme him, Mac Dermond), a great man, being
apprehended by the Lord President for suspicion of intelligence with
Spaine, made an escape, and is out in action, together with the Lord
Roche, and divers other of his frends and followers. He had a
sonne, a proper youth, at Oxford, who was lately sent for, and
committed to the keper of the Court of Wardes. They speake of an
embargo in Spaine of all Scottish and Irish, so that they must
seeke trafficke elswhere. We have much talke of an apparition in
Wales, not far from Chester, of great troupes of horse and foote in
battell array, seene upon a mountaine by sixteen or eighteen persons
of credit, but when they came to discover what they were sodainly
vanisht. We have here foure youthes come from Moscovie to learne
our language and Latin, and are to be dispersed to divers schooles
at Winchester, Eaton, Cambridge, and Oxford. One Perkins,a a
prime man at Cambridge, and of great esteme with the precise
faction, is lately dead ; and another eclipse is befaln that
Universitie, for Dr. Plaifer, the Divinitie reader, is lately crackt in the
headpeece for the love of a wench, as some say. Sir Walter
Lewson is dead in the Fleet, and so his creditors paide in theire
eare. Mrs. Bodley hath lately lost her eldest sonne, Captaine Ball,b in
the Lowe Countries by sicknes. The young Lady North is brought
to bed of a sonne ; and the common report is that Dr. Dee hath
delivered the Lady Sandes of a devill, or of some other straunge
possession. Your Lady Thomas Norris is become a great
Catholique, and takes great care and paines to convert her sisters. I have
nothing els, but to pray you commend me to Mr. Winwod if he
be still there, and tell him the voice runs still with him for
Mr. Gilpins place ; and yet I am told there be above twenty suters,
besides Wheelerc and blacke Milles. Since before dinner I have
heard further that Sir Francis Vere hath ben robd in his chamber of
2,000l. in gold, and some say he is dead of his hurt. Besides
Captaine Ball, there be many other Captaines lately dead in the Lowe
Countries, as Lile, Clifford, Keyes, Richards, Vanifor, Deacons,
Crofts, Drake, and above fowre thousand of the sixe that went last
over. Harry Butler,a that killed Russell, is taken at Carlile, going
for Spaine, with letters for the Duke of Feria. This is all, unles I
shold tell you that a prentise, pursued by his master to be beaten,
lept out of a garret by Holbourne Bridge, and fell upon a porters
necke and got away without harme. Mr. Backhouse and Mr. Borlas
have them kindly commended to you ; and the drie-handed Knight
must not be forgotten, for he remembered it to me by a letter out of
the countrie. And so I leave you to Gods holy protection.
From London this 4th of November, 1602.
Yours most assuredly,         John Chamberlain.
The Dutch men had set out a relation of the fight with the
gallies, which we allow not, neither indeed do theire owne tales
agree ; whereupon I thought goode to send you this report of
Sir Robert Mansell, in aunswer of those drunken companions.
[Addressed,]
To my assured goode frende
Mr. Dudley Carleton
geve these.
