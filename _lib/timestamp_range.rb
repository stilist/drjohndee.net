require 'date'

# This is a na√Øve, simplistic implementation of the ISO 8601 date format and
# interval syntax. It's only capable of handling very basic inputs, but
# currently that's all I need. (Notably, it can't handle the shorthand interval
# syntax -- for example, `1500-01-01/02`.)
#
# The `ISO8601` Ruby gem is much more robust, but has a few issues of its own.
